# Directive Flow Gap Analysis

**Date**: 2025-12-18
**Status**: Phase 1 Review - Gap Identification
**Analyzed File**: `docs/directives-json/directive_flow_project.json` (53 flows)
**Reference**: `docs/DIRECTIVE_WORKFLOW_PATH.md` (comprehensive workflow documentation)

---

## Executive Summary

The `directive_flow_project.json` file successfully implements the **core workflow architecture** with excellent structural integrity. However, coverage analysis reveals **76% directive coverage** (29 of 38 project directives), with **7 critical directives** explicitly mentioned in the workflow documentation but missing from flows.

**Verdict**: ✅ **Strong foundation, incomplete implementation**

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Phase 2 additions** to complete the workflow mapping as documented.

---

## Analysis Methodology

### Verification Steps

1. **Structural Analysis**: Verified loop-back pattern, flow types, and architectural principles
2. **Coverage Analysis**: Compared 38 project directives against directives with flows
3. **Documentation Cross-Reference**: Identified directives mentioned in DIRECTIVE_WORKFLOW_PATH.md but missing flows
4. **Workflow Completeness**: Assessed whether documented workflows are fully implemented

### Reference Sources

- `docs/DIRECTIVE_WORKFLOW_PATH.md` (850 lines, comprehensive workflow)
- `docs/directives-json/directives-project.json` (38 project directives)
- `docs/directives-json/directive_flow_project.json` (53 flows)

---

## ✅ What's Correct and Well-Implemented

### 1. Core Architecture Principles

**Loop-Back Pattern** ✓
- All 21 completion directives correctly return to `aifp_status`
- Zero exceptions to the loop-back rule
- Perfect implementation of state re-evaluation pattern

**Entry Point Flow** ✓
- `aifp_run → aifp_status` (status_branch, priority 100)
- `aifp_run → user_preferences_sync` (canonical, priority 100)
- Correct dual-path entry strategy

**Flow Types** ✓
- 5 flow types properly used:
  - `status_branch` (1 flow) - Entry routing
  - `completion_loop` (21 flows) - All return to aifp_status
  - `conditional` (23 flows) - State-based branching
  - `canonical` (7 flows) - Standard sequences
  - `error_handler` (1 flow) - Error handling

### 2. Workflow Integration

**Git Integration** ✓ (6 flows)
- Session start: `aifp_status → git_detect_external_changes`
- File write: `project_file_write → git_sync_state`
- Branch workflow: `git_create_branch → aifp_status`
- Conflict detection: `git_detect_conflicts → git_merge_branch | project_user_referral`
- Merge completion: `git_merge_branch → aifp_status`

**Use Case 2 (User Directive Automation)** ✓ (10 flows)
- Parse → Validate → Status → Implement
- Implement → File Write (AI generates code)
- Approve → Activate → Status
- Monitor → Update → File Write
- Complete automation infrastructure workflow

**State-Based Branching** ✓
- Uninitialized: `aifp_status → project_init`
- No tasks: `aifp_status → project_task_decomposition`
- Has work: `aifp_status → project_file_write`
- All complete: `aifp_status → project_completion_check`

### 3. Completion Hierarchy

**All completion directives properly mapped**:
- `project_task_complete → aifp_status` (with milestone auto-detection)
- `project_subtask_complete → aifp_status`
- `project_sidequest_complete → aifp_status`
- `project_milestone_complete → aifp_status`
- `project_completion_check → aifp_status | project_archive`

**Validation**: ✅ Perfect - all completion directives loop back

---

## ❌ Critical Missing Flows

These directives are **explicitly documented** in DIRECTIVE_WORKFLOW_PATH.md as part of core workflow operations but have **zero flows** in directive_flow_project.json.

### Priority 1: Active Work Directives

#### 1. `project_task_update` - Update task progress

**Documentation References**:
- Line 422: "project_task_update (updates progress)"
- Line 438: Listed in Work Directives examples
- Line 807: Listed in Task Management category
- Line 1056: Listed in active work branch

**Missing Flows** (2 flows):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "project_task_update",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "user_requests_task_update",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 75,
  "description": "User updates task progress/status without completing"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_task_update",
  "to_directive": "aifp_status",
  "flow_type": "completion_loop",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "Task updated, loop back to status"
}
```

**Impact**: Cannot track incremental task progress updates

---

#### 2. `project_item_create` - Add new task items

**Documentation References**:
- Line 423: "project_item_create (adds new items)"
- Line 439: Listed in Work Directives examples
- Line 813: Listed in Task Management category

**Context from notes.txt**:
- Line 176: "all task items should be created as soon as task is created"
- Implies both auto-creation and manual creation paths

**Missing Flows** (3 flows):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_task_create",
  "to_directive": "project_item_create",
  "flow_type": "canonical",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "Auto-create task items when task is created"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "project_item_create",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "user_requests_new_item",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 70,
  "description": "Manual item creation for existing task"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_item_create",
  "to_directive": "aifp_status",
  "flow_type": "completion_loop",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "Items created, loop back to status"
}
```

**Impact**: Cannot manage task items (smallest work unit)

---

#### 3. `project_reserve_finalize` - Reserve file/function IDs

**Documentation References**:
- Line 442: Listed in Work Directives examples
- Line 821: Listed in File & Code Management category

**Context**: Reserve IDs in database before writing files to avoid conflicts

**Missing Flows** (2 flows):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_file_write",
  "to_directive": "project_reserve_finalize",
  "flow_type": "canonical",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "Reserve file/function IDs before writing to database"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_reserve_finalize",
  "to_directive": "project_update_db",
  "flow_type": "canonical",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "After reserving IDs, proceed with database update"
}
```

**Current Issue**: `project_file_write → project_update_db` direct flow skips ID reservation
**Impact**: Potential database conflicts without ID pre-allocation

---

### Priority 2: File Management Directives

#### 4. `project_file_read` - Read file with context

**Documentation References**:
- Line 818: Listed in File & Code Management category

**Missing Flows** (2 flows):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "project_file_read",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "file_context_needed",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 70,
  "description": "Read file to gather context for work"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_file_read",
  "to_directive": "aifp_status",
  "flow_type": "completion_loop",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "File read complete, return context"
}
```

**Impact**: Cannot explicitly read files for context (though file_write exists)

---

#### 5. `project_file_delete` - Delete file + DB cleanup

**Documentation References**:
- Line 819: Listed in File & Code Management category

**Missing Flows** (2 flows):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "project_file_delete",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "user_requests_file_delete",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 75,
  "description": "Delete file and cleanup database references"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_file_delete",
  "to_directive": "aifp_status",
  "flow_type": "completion_loop",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "File deleted, database cleaned up, loop back"
}
```

**Impact**: Cannot remove files from project tracking

---

#### 6. `project_add_path` - Add file to tracking

**Documentation References**:
- Line 820: Listed in File & Code Management category

**Missing Flows** (2 flows):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "project_add_path",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "user_adds_existing_file",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 70,
  "description": "Add existing file to AIFP tracking"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_add_path",
  "to_directive": "aifp_status",
  "flow_type": "completion_loop",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "File added to tracking, loop back"
}
```

**Impact**: Cannot bring existing files into AIFP project tracking

---

### Priority 3: Entry & Help Directive

#### 7. `aifp_help` - Directive help/documentation

**Documentation References**:
- Line 797: Listed in Entry & Status category (3 total directives)

**Context**: One of only 3 entry/status directives alongside aifp_run and aifp_status

**Missing Flows** (3 flows):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_run",
  "to_directive": "aifp_help",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "user_requests_help",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 90,
  "description": "User requests directive help/documentation"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "aifp_help",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "directive_guidance_needed",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 70,
  "description": "AI needs directive clarification during work"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_help",
  "to_directive": "aifp_status",
  "flow_type": "completion_loop",
  "condition_key": null,
  "priority": 100,
  "description": "Help provided, return to status"
}
```

**Impact**: No documented help/guidance workflow

---

## ⚠️ Secondary Missing Flows (Phase 2-3)

These directives are listed in the "Complete Project Management Directive List" (lines 790-847) but not yet in flows. They are **lower priority** and can be added in Phase 2-3.

### Analysis & Validation (7 directives)

**Not in flows**:
- `project_performance_summary` - Performance analysis (line 832) ⚠️ **TRACKING-RELATED**
- `project_dependency_map` - Dependency visualization (line 834)
- `project_theme_flow_mapping` - Theme/flow mapping (line 835)

**Already in flows** ✓:
- `project_compliance_check` ✓ (FP code validation, not user tracking)
- `project_error_handling` ✓
- `project_metrics` ✓ (project progress metrics from project.db, not user tracking)
- `project_completion_check` ✓

**Missing Flows**: ~6 flows (to/from aifp_status for 3 directives)

**⚠️ TRACKING CONCERN**: `project_performance_summary` tracks directive execution outcomes (successes, retries, failures) and stores them in notes for audit. This should be **opt-in via `tracking_toggle`** in user_preferences.db, not enabled by default.

---

### Maintenance (5 directives)

**Not in flows**:
- `project_dependency_sync` - Sync dependencies (line 837)
- `project_integrity_check` - Data integrity validation (line 838)
- `project_auto_resume` - Auto-resume work (line 839)
- `project_auto_summary` - Auto-generate summaries (line 840)

**Already in flows** ✓:
- `project_user_referral` ✓

**Missing Flows**: ~8 flows (to/from aifp_status for 4 directives)

---

### Database & State (1 directive)

**Not in flows**:
- `project_evolution` - Track project evolution (line 825)

**Already in flows** ✓:
- `project_update_db` ✓

**Missing Flows**: ~2 flows (to/from aifp_status)

---

### Archival (2 directives)

**Not in flows**:
- `project_backup_restore` - Backup/restore operations (line 843)
- `project_refactor_path` - Path refactoring (line 845)

**Already in flows** ✓:
- `project_archive` ✓

**Missing Flows**: ~4 flows (to/from aifp_status for 2 directives)

---

## 🔧 Recommended Amendments to Existing Flows

### 1. Add condition to user_preferences_sync flow

**Current Flow** (line in directive_flow_project.json):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_run",
  "to_directive": "user_preferences_sync",
  "flow_type": "canonical",
  "condition_key": null,
  "condition_value": null,
  "condition_description": "Load user preferences before any customizable directive execution",
  "priority": 100
}
```

**Issue**: No condition specified, but description says "before any customizable directive execution"

**Recommended Amendment**:
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_run",
  "to_directive": "user_preferences_sync",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "directive_is_customizable",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "condition_description": "Load user preferences before any customizable directive execution",
  "priority": 100
}
```

**Reference**: DIRECTIVE_WORKFLOW_PATH.md:122 - "User preferences MUST be loaded before executing any directive that can be customized"

---

### 2. Insert project_reserve_finalize into file_write sequence

**Current Sequence**:
```
project_file_write → project_update_db (canonical)
```

**Recommended Sequence**:
```
project_file_write → project_reserve_finalize (canonical)
project_reserve_finalize → project_update_db (canonical)
```

**Action**:
1. Remove existing flow: `project_file_write → project_update_db`
2. Add new flow: `project_file_write → project_reserve_finalize`
3. Add new flow: `project_reserve_finalize → project_update_db`

**Reference**: DIRECTIVE_WORKFLOW_PATH.md:442 - "project_reserve_finalize - Reserve file/function IDs"

---

### 3. Clarify project_item_create auto-creation

**Current State**: `project_task_create → aifp_status` (direct)

**Recommended Addition**:
```
project_task_create → project_item_create (canonical, auto-create items)
project_item_create → aifp_status (completion_loop)
```

**Reference**: notes.txt:176 - "all task items should be created as soon as task is created"

**Rationale**: Task creation workflow should be:
1. Milestone exists (part of completion_path)
2. Task created for specific position in milestone
3. Items **immediately auto-created** for that task
4. Items represent the list of work needed for task completion
5. No manual item creation required after task creation (items should exist from the start)

---

### 4. Add tracking_enabled condition to project_performance_summary

**Issue**: `project_performance_summary` tracks directive execution outcomes (successes, retries, failures) and stores them for audit. This is tracking behavior that should be **opt-in**, not enabled by default.

**Directive Description**:
> "Summarizes recent directive outcomes, including successes, retries, and failures, and stores summaries in notes for audit. Keeps a rolling summary of directive performance for reliability tracking."

**Current State**: No flows exist yet (secondary directive), but when added in Phase 2-3, they MUST include tracking conditions.

**Recommended Flow** (when added):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "project_performance_summary",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "helper_function_logging_enabled",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "condition_description": "Performance tracking opt-in via tracking_toggle in user_preferences.db",
  "priority": 60,
  "description": "Generate performance summary only if tracking explicitly enabled"
}
```

**Tracking Toggle Integration**:
- `tracking_toggle` directive in user_preferences.db controls features:
  - `fp_flow_tracking` - FP directive flow tracking
  - `issue_reports` - Issue reporting
  - `ai_interaction_log` - AI interaction logging
  - `helper_function_logging` - Helper function performance tracking ← **This one**

**Action**: Do NOT add `project_performance_summary` flows without `helper_function_logging_enabled` condition.

**Related Directives to Review**:
- `project_metrics` - Currently calculates project completion % and task distribution from project.db. This analyzes PROJECT DATA (tasks, milestones), NOT user behavior. **No tracking concern** - this is project progress analysis.
- `project_compliance_check` - Validates FP code compliance. **No tracking concern** - this is code validation.

**Clarification**:
- **Project progress metrics** (completion %, task distribution) = Analyzing project.db = NOT tracking
- **Directive performance metrics** (success/retry/failure rates) = Tracking directive execution = REQUIRES opt-in

---

### 5. Clarify project_compliance_check frequency and purpose

**Issue**: Compliance checking could run too frequently, causing AI to spend more time checking code than writing it. FP directives were designed as **reference material**, not step-by-step execution.

**Current Flow** (already in directive_flow_project.json):
```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_file_write",
  "to_directive": "project_compliance_check",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "check_fp_compliance",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 80,
  "description": "Optional FP compliance validation (user preference)"
}
```

**Good News**: Flow is already conditional with `check_fp_compliance` condition ✓

**Architectural Principles**:
1. **AI writes FP-compliant code by default** (system prompt guidance)
2. **FP directives = reference only** (AI consults when uncertain)
3. **Compliance check = quality gate**, not automatic after every write
4. **User control** via preferences (auto_fix_violations, strict_mode, fp_strictness_level)

**When Should `check_fp_compliance = true`?**

**Default OFF** (trust AI's FP knowledge):
- ✅ AI writes code following FP principles automatically
- ✅ No compliance check after file write (unless user enables)
- ✅ AI consults FP directives as reference when needed

**User Preference: Enable Auto-Check** (opt-in):
- User sets `auto_check_compliance = true` in user_preferences.db
- Compliance check runs after every file write
- Useful for strict FP enforcement or learning

**On-Demand Only** (recommended default):
- **User explicitly requests**: "Check FP compliance"
- **AI is uncertain**: AI consults FP directives and runs check
- **Milestone completion**: Quality gate before marking milestone complete
- **Pre-merge**: Before merging branches (quality assurance)

**Recommended Flow Amendment**:

**Current condition**: `check_fp_compliance = true`
**Change to**: `auto_check_compliance_enabled = true` (user preference from user_preferences.db)

**New flows to add**:
```json
{
  "from_directive": "aifp_status",
  "to_directive": "project_compliance_check",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "user_requests_compliance_check",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 70,
  "description": "On-demand compliance check when user explicitly requests"
}
```

```json
{
  "from_directive": "project_milestone_complete",
  "to_directive": "project_compliance_check",
  "flow_type": "conditional",
  "condition_key": "milestone_quality_gate_enabled",
  "condition_value": "true",
  "priority": 90,
  "description": "Optional quality gate: check compliance before milestone completion"
}
```

**Summary**:
- **Default**: No auto-compliance check (AI writes FP code by default)
- **User preference**: Enable `auto_check_compliance` for strict enforcement
- **On-demand**: User requests or milestone quality gates
- **Purpose**: Quality assurance, not constant validation

**Related User Preferences** (already in compliance_check workflow):
- `auto_fix_violations` - Auto-fix FP violations vs. report only
- `skip_warnings` - Skip warning-level issues
- `strict_mode` - Strictest FP enforcement
- `fp_strictness_level` - Low/medium/high strictness

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 2 - Week 1: Critical Additions (Target: 67 flows)

**Add 7 critical directives** (14 flows + 3 amendments = 17 changes):

**High Priority**:
1. ✅ `project_task_update` (2 flows)
2. ✅ `project_item_create` (3 flows including auto-create)
3. ✅ `project_reserve_finalize` (2 flows + amend existing)
4. ✅ `project_file_read` (2 flows)
5. ✅ `project_file_delete` (2 flows)
6. ✅ `project_add_path` (2 flows)
7. ✅ `aifp_help` (3 flows)

4. **DO NOT add** `project_performance_summary` without `helper_function_logging_enabled` condition (tracking opt-in)
5. Clarify `project_compliance_check` frequency (default OFF, user opt-in for auto-check)
6. Add on-demand compliance check flows (user request, milestone quality gate)

**Result**: 53 + 14 new flows + 2 compliance flows = **69 flows** (after amendments)

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 days

---

### Phase 2 - Week 2-3: Secondary Additions (Target: 90-100 flows)

**Final Target**: **95-100 flows**

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 weeks

---

### Phase 3 - Week 4: Validation & Polish (Target: 100-120 flows)

1. **Add error paths**: Error handlers for complex directives
2. **Add alternative paths**: Multiple valid approaches for key directives
3. **Add recovery paths**: Failed operation recovery flows
4. **Validate completeness**: Ensure every directive has at least one flow
5. **Document edge cases**: Conditional flows for unusual states

**Final Target**: **100-120 flows**

**Time Estimate**: 3-5 days

## 📝 Conclusion

### Strengths ✓
1. **Core architecture is excellent**: Loop-back pattern, flow types, priorities all correct
2. **Git integration is complete**: All 6 flows properly implemented
3. **Use Case 2 is complete**: All 10 user directive flows properly implemented
4. **Structural integrity**: No violations of architectural principles

### Gaps ⚠️
1. **Active work directives**: 3 of 5 missing (task_update, item_create, reserve_finalize)
2. **File management**: 3 of 4 missing (file_read, file_delete, add_path)
3. **Help system**: aifp_help not integrated
4. **Overall coverage**: 76% (29 of 38 directives)

### Clarifications Added ℹ️
1. **Task/Item creation**: Items auto-created immediately when task created (not manual)
2. **Compliance check frequency**: Default OFF (trust AI's FP knowledge), opt-in for auto-check
3. **Performance tracking**: `project_performance_summary` requires tracking opt-in
4. **Metrics vs Tracking**: Project metrics (progress) ≠ performance tracking (execution logs)

### Recommendation ✅

**Proceed with Phase 2 additions following the action plan above.**

The foundation is solid and follows the documented architecture correctly. The missing flows are **additive** (not corrective), meaning:
- No existing flows need removal
- 6 amendments needed (3 structural + 3 clarifications)
- All additions follow established patterns
- No architectural redesign required
- User privacy/preferences respected (tracking opt-in, compliance opt-in)

**Estimated Completion Time**: 3-4 weeks for full Phase 2-3 implementation
