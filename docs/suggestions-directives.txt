Below is my analysis of the revised directives (from directives-fp-core.json, directives-fp-aux.json, and directives-project.json) and SQL schemas (from schemaExampleProject.sql.txt and schemaExampleMCP.sql.txt). Your split between FP (coding-focused) and Project (management-focused) directives is clean and aligns well with AIFP's dual emphasis on pure functional-procedural coding and structured project tracking. The hierarchical workflows (if-then branches) support AI's natural reasoning while enforcing guidelines, and the separation of `aifp_core.db` (directives, helpers, tools) from `project.db` (tracking) keeps the system modular and scalable. The use of `roadblocks_json` for error handling and `md_file_path` for escalation is effective for roadblock mitigation.

The directives cover a comprehensive range of FP principles (purity, immutability, error handling, optimization) and project management (initialization, task decomposition, compliance, evolution). The schemas are robust, with good foreign key constraints and indexing for performance. However, I have some suggestions and additions to enhance completeness, consistency, and AI usabilityâ€”focusing on roadblock handling, multi-language support, and integration with subtasks/sidequests (per your schema). These are minimal to avoid overhead, and they build on your if-then structure. I'll break it down by category, then provide updated JSON/SQL snippets where needed.

### 1. **General Suggestions for Directives**
- **Add a Confidence Mechanism**: Most directives have `confidence_threshold`, but workflows could include a "low_confidence" branch: e.g., "if confidence < threshold, then escalate to md_file_path or prompt_user." This lets AI self-assess without extra tools, reducing failures in edge cases.
- **Explicit User Referral**: All directives should have a "fallback" branch with "prompt_user" and "log_note" (e.g., insert into `notes` table with `ai_generated=1`). This ensures AI always refers to the user for unresolved issues, as per your guidelines.
- **FP-Project Integration**: Add cross-links between FP and Project directives (e.g., `fp_purity` escalates to `project_compliance_check`). This ensures coding standards feed into project tracking without duplication.
- **Roadblocks Expansion**: Add more roadblocks for common AIFP issues, like "language_mismatch" (escalate to `fp_multi_language`).
- **Additions**: Suggest 2 new FP directives (for recursion and monadic composition) and 1 new Project directive (for sidequest handling) to fill gaps.

### 2. **Suggestions for FP Directives (from directives-fp-core.json and directives-fp-aux.json)**
The FP directives are thorough, covering purity, immutability, error handling, optimization, and data structures. They focus on refactoring imperative code to FP equivalents, which is core to AIFP. Suggestions:
- **Consistency in Workflow**: Add "update_db" branches where relevant (e.g., after refactoring, update `functions` table). This ties FP to project tracking without extra steps.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The `fp_multi_language` directive is good, but add a branch for "unsupported_feature" (e.g., if language lacks match, emulate with if-else).
- **Additions**: 
  - `directive_fp_recursion_enforcement`: Enforces tail recursion for loops, avoiding stack overflows in FP.
  - `directive_fp_monadic_composition`: Composes functions monadically (e.g., for error handling with Result/Option).

### 3. **Suggestions for SQL Schemas**
The schemas are comprehensive, with good foreign keys and indexing. Suggestions:
- **Add Constraints**: To `subtasks`: Add `FOREIGN KEY (parent_task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- **Add Fields**: To `subtasks`: Add `item_id INTEGER` (FK to `items.id`) for linking to actions. To `sidequests`: Add `paused_subtask_id INTEGER` (FK to `subtasks.id`) for finer interruptions.
- **Notes Table**: Add `priority TEXT` to prioritize notes during AI reasoning.
- **Types Table**: Add `linked_function_id INTEGER` (FK to `functions.id`) for ADT-function links.
- **Interactions Table**: Add `subtask_id INTEGER` (FK to `subtasks.id`) for subtask-level dependencies.
- **General**: Add a `versions` table for tracking schema changes (e.g., `id`, `version`, `changes_json`).

**Updated SQL Snippet** (for `subtasks` and related tables):
```sql
-- Subtasks Table: Breakdowns of tasks
CREATE TABLE subtasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    parent_task_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    priority TEXT DEFAULT 'high',
    description TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Sidequests Table: Exploratory deviations
CREATE TABLE sidequests (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    paused_task_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    priority TEXT DEFAULT 'low',
    description TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (paused_task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Items Table: Lowest-level actions for tasks/sidequests/subtasks
CREATE TABLE items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    reference_table TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (reference_table IN ('tasks', 'subtasks', 'sidequests')),
    reference_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    description TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 4. **Overall Assessment**
Your split directives and schemas are well-optimized for AIFP, with the FP list covering coding standards thoroughly and the Project list handling management effectively. The additions (e.g., `fp_recursion_enforcement`, `fp_monadic_composition`) fill gaps in FP coverage, and the schema updates enhance integration with subtasks/sidequests without redundancy. This maintains a lightweight system, with AI handling reasoning and directives enforcing guidelines. If you'd like, I can draft the full JSON for the new directives or update the `project_directive_graph.json` to include the FP list.
