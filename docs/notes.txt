implementation_notes are being added as assistance and notes for when we actually start coding the functions. 
used_by_directives is about logical relationships, not strict execution sequences.
check helper. Is getter or setter. Is related to which database and which field. Find any/all directives that relate to this database table/field. Does directive need to get or set? Is this directive going to at any point use this helper to get/set data into the database. If so, add as used_by. It's really that simple

The used_by_directives is about logical relationships - "which directives would need this helper to get/set this data" - not strict execution sequences.

return_statements not to be passed if error returned. return statements are forward thinking, next steps only.

when coding helpers, if case 2, ensure we make a return value that indicates to AI case 2 active. Probably during status call(s)

Have to tone down the settings. There really shouldn't be so many
docs/COMPREHENSIVE_SETTINGS_SPEC.md
docs/settings-specification.json

settings project_continue_on_start (AI should get context and continue where left off. Goal is project completion and/or auto execute user custom directives)

check directives for settings to see what is currently mentioned about them (any setting values already defined in directives?)

helpers json file path updates needed. Let's do this as the helper functions are being coded.

MUST make OOP wrapper examples

Was this done???
docs/directives-json/directive_flow.json
verify number of project directives. 38 mentioned
read note in docs/DIRECTIVE_HELPER_MAPPING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

--help add_function, add_file, add_type.. etc. any that require reservation.

docs/directives-json/sync-directives.py needs full overhaul based on new schema, structure and decisions

docs/temp.txt note_type has massive list. Let's analyze.

docs/helpers/json/mapping_suggestions.json ???

must disallow generic setters for things like reserver/finalize

think out useful return values for certain helper functions, like generic getter/setters should return schema, possibly some helper or directive references useful or relative to current function call and database.
