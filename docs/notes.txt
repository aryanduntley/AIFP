The blueprints/context for the project are located in docs/blueprints and the directive json files are located in docs/directives-json. 

are we handling oop wrapping appropriately with our directives. Probably some example files.

directives file for each db table?

Notes are md examples and init structuring are the idea evolution files
docs/directiveNotes/*
docs/initialStructuring/*
Should we make an md file for each and every directive title? ie. (project_init, project_task_decomposition, fp_purity, aifp_run)


NEED DB import/export/migration py scripts

find_directive_by_intent helper
ensure helper functionsfor all directives that could use it; there are some that may not need helper functions and should be AI processing only

project status prompt?
