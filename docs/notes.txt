dev blueprints are in docs/blueprints/{}.md and the directive json files are located in docs/directives-json/{}, production directive md files located in src/aifp/reference/directives/{}.md. .aifp/ is our project management folder for dev, our project management/tracking database is there. We are following the FP coding style and managing the project through the project database in .aifp to ensure consistent and updated status. After every batch of completions, update the database to reflect the completed work.

REVIEW ALL HELPER FUNCTIONS. AI made many mistakes, making up parameters, ommitting others, etc. Review all.
document flow ids json filed to tasks and sidequests tables in project db schema
remove project id, update documentation to reflect

--help add_function, add_file, add_type.. etc. any that require reservation.

New directive requiring that files, functions types be reserved in database before writing to avoid potential cleanup aftermath if created before adding to database with many references. New additons of these types will require the id suffixed to the name, so reservation is important. After creation, the finalization functions must be called to update the name (at least) after write creations.

database change:
TRIGGERS

- Triggers for timestamp updates
CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS update_project_timestamp
AFTER UPDATE ON project
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE project SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = OLD.id;
END;
what is "OLD.id" about?

database change:
add name to file table. Not just path. If name is there, should path NOT include name? name filed helps with updating name and appending id without having to parse path.

database change:
remove project field (or project_id) from all tables except project table.

database change:
function names unique

database change:
functions table add returns field to provide return values for function

database change:
add return_statements_helpers table to core db. This will map return statements to helper functions. We can add many statements for each helper function.

database change:
CREATE TABLE types_functions (
    type_id INTEGER REFERENCES types(id),
    function_id INTEGER REFERENCES functions(id),
    role TEXT  -- e.g. 'constructor', 'method', 'operator', etc.
);
If useful. Discuss. Would there typically be a many to many relationship between types and functions? If so, should we add _idXXX to types like we do with functions? Potential logic detailed in info-helpers-project.txt

database change:
??? should we add file_id to types???

database change:
add is_reserved field to tables (files, functions and types). AI must first reserve to get id's then make files / write functions (or types) with appropriate naming -IDxxx for files _idxxx for functions and types. Once made and written to, AI can finalize the entries with the real data and mare is_reserved as false.

database change:
status for "complete" or "completed" for all tables should be uniform. we should either use complete or completed. This should be forced if possible. We do not want to look for "complete" when "completed" exists or also exists or not know which to use for which table, etc. Need consistency for this. I suggest "completed"

database change:
severity TEXT 
    CHECK (severity IN ('info', 'warning', 'error'))
    DEFAULT 'info'
for all fields that have these types of options (including status, priority, etc.) we should set checks to ensure we have standards. When searching by severity or status or any others we don't want some arbitrary entries that we would never know to check for. It also prevents issues like status = complete vs status = completed.

database change:
tasks priority field is int while subtask and sidequest priority fields are text. task 0,1,2,... while the others are "low","medium","high", etc. We should have consistency here. Which is more useful, text or int?

database change:
core database
add target_database field to helper_functions table.

database change:
core database add return_statements field to helper_functions table
return_statements for tools and other relevant helpers should always add notes for any directive/db/etc. chaining. return_statements might also include tool and helper function lists for next steps after certain actions

database change:
user preferences database
table ai_interactions filed "directive_context" rename to "directive_name"

database change:
user preferences database
issues_reports table
submitted_at field. Is it useful? What/how would be different from created_at? If no real benefit and no real distiction from created_at, we should remove submitted at.
