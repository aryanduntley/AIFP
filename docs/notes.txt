The blueprints/context for the project are located in docs/blueprints and the directive json files are located in docs/directives-json. 

are we handling oop wrapping appropriately with our directives. Probably some example files.

Notes are md examples and init structuring are the idea evolution files
docs/directiveNotes/*
docs/initialStructuring/*
