dev blueprints are in docs/blueprints/{}.md and the directive json files are located in docs/directives-json/{}, production directive md files located in src/aifp/reference/directives/{}.md. .aifp/ is our project management folder for dev, our project management/tracking database is there. We are following the FP coding style and managing the project through the project database in .aifp to ensure consistent and updated status. After every batch of completions, update the database to reflect the completed work.

--help add_function, add_file, add_type.. etc. any that require reservation.

New directive requiring that files, functions types be reserved in database before writing to avoid potential cleanup aftermath if created before adding to database with many references. New additons of these types will require the id suffixed to the name, so reservation is important. After creation, the finalization functions must be called to update the name (at least) after write creations.

docs/directives-json/sync-directives.py
review available_helpers in directives json files. can remove completely? We must match helpers to directives in directive_helpers table. also directive_interactions and categories with directive_categories. All directive schema data should be available in directives json files as well as all interactions and helper function relationships.
docs/directive-json-schema-alignment-analysis.md
in this analysis, it's conforming to docs/directives-json/sync-directives.py. We can have a better structure for categories, etc. if needed, but I don't know if we need separate files for the linking/relationships. 

separate file for directive_interactions. This would have to be ran after directives entered to get directives by name, return id, so that entries into directive_interactions can happen using ID

separate file for helpers. Each helper json should have directives association by name(s). As a helper is entered into database, gets all listed directives from db by name, retrieves ID, adds directive_helpers relationship to database.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS directive_helpers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    directive_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    helper_function_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    execution_context TEXT,                  -- e.g., 'workflow_step_3', 'error_handler', 'validation'
    sequence_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,        -- Order of execution if multiple helpers in workflow
    is_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,           -- TRUE if helper must execute, FALSE if optional/conditional
    parameters_mapping JSON,                 -- Optional: maps directive workflow params to helper params
    description TEXT,                        -- Brief note on why this helper is used
    UNIQUE(directive_id, helper_function_id, execution_context),
    FOREIGN KEY (directive_id) REFERENCES directives(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (helper_function_id) REFERENCES helper_functions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_directive_helpers_directive ON directive_helpers (directive_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_directive_helpers_helper ON directive_helpers (helper_function_id);


So with this flow, directives don't need to list helper functions. AI should have only a reference to helpers and can use the helpers/tools:
docs/helpers/info-helpers-core.txt :
get_helpers_for_directive(directive_id, include_helpers_data=false)
   include_helpers_data=false return all directive_helpers data for matches
   include_helpers_data=true calls get_helpers_by_id(helper_id array)
      returns all directive_helpers data AND helper_functions data for matches
get_directives_for_helper(helper_function_id, include_directives_data=false)
   include_directives_data=false return all directive_helpers data for matches
   include_directives_data=true calls get_directives(directive_id array)
      returns all directive_helpers data AND directives data for matches

need to flesh out return statements

used_by_directive field in the helper json files needs to be evaluated when re-evaluating directives

src/aifp/reference/directives/user_preferences_update.md
new simpler template with no helper functions. system prompt tells AI to use get_helpers_for_directive(directive_id, include_helpers_data=true) so no need to add that even to the md files. Keep them clean with conceptual information not function calls.

 -- MD5/SHA256 checksum of ProjectBlueprint.md for sync validation
 file and blueprint file checksum removed from poject database. Should be no reason for it as we have git for historical reference. 

 intent_keywords_json removed from core replaced with directives_intent_keywords table
