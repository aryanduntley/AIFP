dev blueprints are in docs/blueprints/{}.md and the directive json files are located in docs/directives-json/{}, production directive md files located in src/aifp/reference/directives/{}.md. .aifp/ is our project management folder for dev, our project management/tracking database is there. We are following the FP coding style and managing the project through the project database in .aifp to ensure consistent and updated status. After every batch of completions, update the database to reflect the completed work.

update with new helpers, fix paths (tools/ subdir and file names)

--help add_function, add_file, add_type.. etc. any that require reservation.

New directive requiring that files, functions types be reserved in database before writing to avoid potential cleanup aftermath if created before adding to database with many references. New additons of these types will require the id suffixed to the name, so reservation is important. After creation, the finalization functions must be called to update the name (at least) after write creations.

docs/directives-json/sync-directives.py
review available_helpers in directives json files. can remove completely? We must match helpers to directives in directive_helpers table. also directive_interactions and categories with directive_categories. All directive schema data should be available in directives json files as well as all interactions and helper function relationships.
docs/directive-json-schema-alignment-analysis.md
in this analysis, it's conforming to docs/directives-json/sync-directives.py. We can have a better structure for categories, etc. if needed, but I don't know if we need separate files for the linking/relationships. 

If I were to write this myself, I would create one sync-directives.py file that reads the directive json. Fore each json directive entry, it would make the directive table entry. read any categories check existing (get id if so) else add to categories table, then add the directive_categories entry. 

separate file for directive_interactions. This would have to be ran after directives entered to get directives by name, return id, so that entries into directive_interactions can happen using ID

separate file for helpers. Each helper json should have directives association by name(s). As a helper is entered into database, gets all listed directives from db by name, retrieves ID, adds directive_helpers relationship to database.

So with this flow, directives don't need to list helper functions. AI should have only a reference to helpers and can use the helpers/tools:
docs/helpers/info-helpers-core.txt :
get_helpers_for_directive(directive_id, include_helpers_data=false)
   include_helpers_data=false return all directive_helpers data for matches
   include_helpers_data=true calls get_helpers_by_id(helper_id array)
      returns all directive_helpers data AND helper_functions data for matches
get_directives_for_helper(helper_function_id, include_directives_data=false)
   include_directives_data=false return all directive_helpers data for matches
   include_directives_data=true calls get_directives(directive_id array)
      returns all directive_helpers data AND directives data for matches

let's make these source of truth:
docs/helpers/info-helpers-user-settings.txt
docs/helpers/info-helpers-project.txt
docs/helpers/info-helpers-core.txt
docs/helpers/info-helpers-user-custom.txt

need to consolidate all helpers and remove excess files to avoid confusion:
docs/helpers/helper-architecture.md
docs/helpers/helper-tool-classification.md
docs/helpers/generic-tools-mcp.md
docs/helpers/generic-tools-project.md
docs/helpers/helper-functions-reference.md
docs/directives-json/directive-helper-interactions.json
docs/directives-json/helpers_parsed.json

need to flesh out return statements


reference user_settings for directives and all useful places in return_statements where appropriate

working on:
docs/helper-registry-progress.md
docs/helpers/registry/helpers_registry_core.json
docs/helpers/registry/helpers_registry_project.json
docs/helpers/registry/helpers_registry_user_directives.json
docs/helpers/registry/helpers_registry_user_directives_getters.json
docs/helpers/registry/helpers_registry_user_settings.json
docs/helpers/helper-sources-comparison.md

docs/helpers/registry/helpers_registry_user_directives.json
is being split into separate files getters and setters. getters done
docs/helpers/registry/helpers_registry_user_directives_getters.json
setters needs to be created. We are using the docs/helpers/info-helpers-user-custom.txt file for this.

for project must do something similar but need more than 2 files. There are over 200 project helpers I believe. Maybe helpers_registry_project_structure_getters.json helpers_registry_project_structure_setters.json helpers_registry_project_workflow_getters.json helpers_registry_project_workflow_setters.json structure will be files, functions, project infrastructure, etc. workflow would be themes, flow, taks, items, notes, etc.
