The blueprints/context for the project are located in docs/blueprints and the directive json files are located in docs/directives-json.

are we handling oop wrapping appropriately with our directives. Probably some example files.

directives file for each db table?

need directives file for git related tracking, evolve to multi-user/multi-ai tracking with pull requests, etc.
must have directives regarding versioning and proper use of notes and items tables

"Add cross-links between FP and Project directives" from docs/suggestions-directives.txt pending. discuss.

Notes are md examples and init structuring are the idea evolution files
docs/directiveNotes/*
docs/initialStructuring/*
Should we make an md file for each and every directive title? ie. (project_init, project_task_decomposition, fp_purity, aifp_run)


NEED DB import/export/migration py scripts

find_directive_by_intent helper
ensure helper functionsfor all directives that could use it; there are some that may not need helper functions and should be AI processing only


Need system prompt for MCP to guide AI on using MCP for coding guidance and project management guidance (instead of just tools via API like most other MCP's). if AIFP MCP present, always assume and run aifp_run unless explicitly rejected "do not use aifp for this specific task".

check on project init directives what they do and what they should do.
check on project status directives and ensure they get current context appropriately.
project status should be run before init, if no status available, must run init.
