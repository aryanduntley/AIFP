Do not read or modify notes.txt. That is just for me.

are we done with all the sidequests?

project helpers coded, but database file location. How is it being determined? Are we hard-coding file path. If so, we must consider the aifp project folder name change in user settings. Should just remove the ability to change it if exists.
All 4 infrastructure directory helpers now use the PROJECT_DB_PATH constant internally instead of taking it as a parameter. Much cleaner API - the  functions just do what they're supposed to do without requiring the caller to know about database paths.
 
return_statements for global mutable db (remember to rewrite the reference CRUD for mutable global db file in project language... with reference to that CRUD reference file location)

return statements for aifp_init

check all directive json and md files for direct queries (select, insert, etc.)

COMPLETED BUT VALUABLE INFO FOR when begin CODING AIFP_RUN
docs/settings-integration-implementation.md

make sure we add the mutable global db to project src

when coding helpers, if case 2, ensure we make a return value that indicates to AI case 2 active. Probably during status call(s)

think out useful return values for certain helper functions, like generic getter/setters should return schema, possibly some helper or directive references useful or relative to current function call and database.

helpers json file path updates needed. Let's do this as the helper functions are being coded.

MUST make OOP wrapper examples

--help add_function, add_file, add_type.. etc. any that require reservation.
