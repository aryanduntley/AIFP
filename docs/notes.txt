dev blueprints are in docs/blueprints/{}.md and the directive json files are located in docs/directives-json/{}, production directive md files located in src/aifp/reference/directives/{}.md. .aifp/ is our project management folder for dev, our project management/tracking database is there. We are following the FP coding style and managing the project through the project database in .aifp to ensure consistent and updated status. After every batch of completions, update the database to reflect the completed work.
