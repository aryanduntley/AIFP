=============================

Check all of these for any needed changes. especially in regards to docs/settings-design-integration.md
docs/directives-json/directives-user-pref.json
docs/directives-json/directive_flow_user_preferences.json
src/aifp/reference/directives/user_preferences_sync.md
src/aifp/reference/directives/user_preferences_import.md
src/aifp/reference/directives/user_preferences_update.md

BOTH directive json and md files:
check all directives for settings
check directives for settings to see what is currently mentioned about them (any setting values already defined in directives?)
docs/settings-cleanup-summary.md phase 5

directive-flow was cleaned? I believe so, but let's ensure.
settings minimalistic. They are meant to evolve and be added by the user according to user's preferences.

check generic directive getters, if any. Must ensure we load queried directive specific settings along with directive data for AI to prevent possibility of setting not being queried separately or being "forgotten"

Review aifp_run returns, including settings. How much data? too extensive? Should we tone it down?

============================

COMPLETED BUT VALUABLE INFO FOR when begin CODING AIFP_RUN
docs/settings-integration-implementation.md

return_statements not to be passed if error returned. return statements are forward thinking, next steps only.

when coding helpers, if case 2, ensure we make a return value that indicates to AI case 2 active. Probably during status call(s)

must disallow generic setters for things like reserver/finalize

think out useful return values for certain helper functions, like generic getter/setters should return schema, possibly some helper or directive references useful or relative to current function call and database.

helpers json file path updates needed. Let's do this as the helper functions are being coded.

MUST make OOP wrapper examples

--help add_function, add_file, add_type.. etc. any that require reservation.

docs/directives-json/sync-directives.py needs full overhaul based on new schema, structure and decisions

docs/temp.txt note_type has massive list. Let's analyze. notes table note_type all over the place. Need to consolidate to just a handful of the most useful.
