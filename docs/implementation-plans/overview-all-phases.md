## Phase Interdependencies

### Critical Path

```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Directives) - BLOCKING for minimum viable release
    ↓
Phase 5 (Packaging) - Public release
    ↓
Phase 6 (Community) - Long-term success
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities

After Phase 1 completes:

```
Phase 2 (Directives)  ←→  Phase 3 (User Directives)
        ↓                          ↓
    Phase 4 (Advanced Features) ←──┘
        ↓
    Phase 5 (Packaging)
```

**Rationale**:
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 but can proceed independently of Phase 2
- Phase 4 can start once Phase 2 is stable (doesn't need completion)
- Allows parallel development teams if resources available

---

## Development Principles

### Across All Phases

1. **Pure FP Always**: Every function follows FP principles
2. **Test-Driven**: Tests written before implementation
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase produces working code
4. **Meta-Circular**: Use `.aifp/` to track AIFP development
5. **Documentation-First**: Update docs with code changes
6. **Performance-Aware**: Benchmark early, optimize continuously
7. **Security-Conscious**: Security reviews at every phase

### Code Quality Standards

- **Type Hints**: 100% coverage on all functions
- **Test Coverage**: >90% across all code
- **FP Compliance**: Zero mutations, explicit side effects
- **Documentation**: Docstrings on all public functions
- **Review Required**: No direct commits to main branch

---
