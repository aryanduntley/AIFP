# AIFP Directives Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Purpose**: Verify consistency between directive JSON files, MD files, and documentation before MCP server implementation

---

## Executive Summary

### Status: ✅ MOSTLY READY - Minor Updates Needed

**Overall Assessment**: Directive system is structurally sound and ready for Phase 1 implementation with minor updates to system prompt counts.

**Critical Issues**: 0
**Minor Issues**: 1 (outdated counts in system prompt)
**Recommendations**: 2

---

## 1. MD File Path Verification

### ✅ PASS: All paths correctly formatted

**Finding**: All directive JSON files use the correct path format for MCP server structure.

**Path Format**: `"directives/filename.md"`

**Examples Verified**:
```json
// FP Core
"md_file_path": "directives/fp_purity.md"
"md_file_path": "directives/fp_immutability.md"

// FP Auxiliary
"md_file_path": "directives/fp_test_purity.md"
"md_file_path": "directives/fp_api_design.md"

// Project
"md_file_path": "directives/project_file_read.md"
"md_file_path": "directives/project_task_create.md"
```

```
AIFP/
├── src/aifp/reference/
│   ├── directives/               ← MD files currently here
│   └── guides/

│   └── aifp_system_prompt.txt
└── .aifp/                        ← Dev tracking (NOT for users)
```

**✅ Action**: Paths are correct. When building MCP server package, copy from `src/aifp/reference/directives/` → MCP package's `src/aifp/reference/directives/`.

## 2. Directive Count Verification

### Current Totals (Actual)

| Category | Count | JSON File |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **FP Core** | 30 | directives-fp-core.json |
| **FP Auxiliary** | 36 | directives-fp-aux.json |
| **Project** | 32 | directives-project.json |
| **Git** | 6 | directives-git.json |
| **User Preferences** | 7 | directives-user-pref.json |
| **User System** | 8 | directives-user-system.json |
| **System** | 2 | (aifp_run, aifp_status) |
| **TOTAL** | **121** | |

**FP Total**: 66 (30 Core + 36 Auxiliary)

### Documentation Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **directive-documentation-status.md** | ✅ Current | Updated 2025-10-28 with 121 total |
| **directive-md-mapping.csv** | ✅ Current | All 121 directives mapped |
| **README.md** | ✅ Current | Shows 66 FP, 32 Project, 121 total |
| **aifp_system_prompt.txt** | ⚠️ **OUTDATED** | Shows 108 total (old) |

---

## 3. System Prompt Issues

### ⚠️ Issue: Outdated Directive Counts

**File**: `sys-prompt/aifp_system_prompt.txt`

**Current (INCORRECT)**:
```
=== DIRECTIVE CATEGORIES (108 TOTAL) ===

FP Directives (62 total) - How to write code:
...

Project Directives (25 total) - Project lifecycle management:
...
```

**Should Be (CORRECT)**:
```
=== DIRECTIVE CATEGORIES (121 TOTAL) ===

FP Directives (66 total) - How to write code:
- FP Core: 30 directives
- FP Auxiliary: 36 directives
...

Project Directives (32 total) - Project lifecycle management:
...
```

**Impact**: Minor - doesn't affect functionality, but misleads AI about directive availability.

**Fix Required**: Update lines 40, 42, 49 in aifp_system_prompt.txt

---

## 4. Guide References

### ✅ PASS: Guide paths correctly reference MCP structure

**System Prompt (line 327)**:
```
The following guides ship with the AIFP MCP package in src/aifp/reference/guides/
```

**Referenced Guides**:
1. ✅ `automation-projects.md` - Exists at `src/aifp/reference/guides/automation-projects.md`
2. ✅ `project-structure.md` - Exists at `src/aifp/reference/guides/project-structure.md`
3. ✅ `directive-interactions.md` - Exists at `src/aifp/reference/guides/directive-interactions.md`
4. ✅ `git-integration.md` - Exists at `src/aifp/reference/guides/git-integration.md`

**Path Format**: Correct - uses relative MCP package structure.

**Note**: These guides will be embedded in MCP package, not read dynamically. System prompt correctly references them as "shipped with the package" for AI's knowledge, not as file paths to read.

---

## 5. sync-directives.py Configuration

### ✅ PASS: Sync script properly configured

**Database Path**: `aifp_core.db` (line 38)
- ✅ Correct - will create database in MCP server root

**JSON File Paths** (lines 40-59):
```python
FP_DIRECTIVE_FILES = [
    "directives-json/directives-fp-core.json",
    "directives-json/directives-fp-aux.json"
]
PROJECT_DIRECTIVE_FILES = [
    "directives-json/directives-project.json"
]
USER_PREFERENCE_FILES = [
    "directives-json/directives-user-pref.json"
]
USER_SYSTEM_FILES = [
    "directives-json/directives-user-system.json"
]
GIT_DIRECTIVE_FILES = [
    "directives-json/directives-git.json"
]
```

**Status**: ✅ All paths correct for MCP server structure

**Expected Directive Count** (line 23):
```python
Total Directives: 108 (30 FP Core + 32 FP Aux + 25 Project + 7 User Pref + 8 User System + 6 Git)
```

**⚠️ Issue**: Outdated comment. Should be:
```python
Total Directives: 121 (30 FP Core + 36 FP Aux + 32 Project + 7 User Pref + 8 User System + 6 Git + 2 System)
```

**Impact**: Minor - just a comment, doesn't affect functionality.

---

## 6. MD File Consistency Check

### ✅ PASS: All 121 directives have matching MD files

**Verification Method**: Cross-referenced `directive-md-mapping.csv` with filesystem

**Results**:
- 121 directives in JSON files
- 121 corresponding MD files in `src/aifp/reference/directives/`
- 0 orphaned MD files (all are mapped)
- 0 missing MD files (all JSON entries have files)

**Recent Additions** (2025-10-28):
- ✅ `fp_test_purity.md` → JSON
- ✅ `fp_api_design.md` → JSON
- ✅ `fp_documentation.md` → JSON
- ✅ `fp_naming_conventions.md` → JSON
- ✅ `project_file_read.md` → JSON
- ✅ `project_file_delete.md` → JSON
- ✅ `project_task_create.md` → JSON
- ✅ `project_task_update.md` → JSON
- ✅ `project_subtask_create.md` → JSON
- ✅ `project_item_create.md` → JSON
- ✅ `project_sidequest_create.md` → JSON

---

## 7. Development vs Runtime Separation

### ✅ PASS: Clear separation maintained

**Development Tracking** (`.aifp/`):
- ✅ Located at project root
- ✅ Tracks AIFP development itself
- ✅ Contains `project.db` for AIFP's task management
- ✅ Will NOT be included in MCP package

**User Runtime** (`.aifp-project/`):
- ✅ Created in user's project directory
- ✅ Contains user's `project.db`
- ✅ Managed by MCP server directives
- ✅ Completely separate from development

**No Conflicts**: Development `.aifp/` never interferes with user `.aifp-project/`

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Update System Prompt Counts

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 5 minutes
**Impact**: Improves AI accuracy

**Changes Needed** in `sys-prompt/aifp_system_prompt.txt`:
```diff
-=== DIRECTIVE CATEGORIES (108 TOTAL) ===
+=== DIRECTIVE CATEGORIES (121 TOTAL) ===

-FP Directives (62 total) - How to write code:
+FP Directives (66 total) - How to write code:
+- FP Core: 30 directives
+- FP Auxiliary: 36 directives

-Project Directives (25 total) - Project lifecycle management:
+Project Directives (32 total) - Project lifecycle management:
```

### Recommendation 2: Update sync-directives.py Comment

**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: 1 minute
**Impact**: Documentation clarity

**Change** in `docs/sync-directives.py` line 23:
```diff
-Total Directives: 108 (30 FP Core + 32 FP Aux + 25 Project + 7 User Pref + 8 User System + 6 Git)
+Total Directives: 121 (30 FP Core + 36 FP Aux + 32 Project + 7 User Pref + 8 User System + 6 Git + 2 System)
```

---

## 9. Phase 1 Readiness Assessment

### ✅ READY FOR PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION

**Prerequisites Met**:
- ✅ All 121 directives have JSON definitions
- ✅ All 121 directives have MD files
- ✅ All paths correctly formatted for MCP structure
- ✅ sync-directives.py properly configured
- ✅ Development/runtime separation clear
- ✅ Guide files present and referenced

**Next Steps**:
1. **Apply minor updates** (system prompt counts, sync script comment)
2. **Run sync-directives.py** to create `aifp_core.db`
3. **Follow Phase 1 plan** from `docs/implementation-plans/phase-1-mcp-server-bootstrap.md`

**Phase 1 Focus**:
- Bootstrap MCP server
- Implement core infrastructure
- Add 3-5 foundational directives (aifp_run, project_init, etc.)
- Establish testing framework
- Phase 2 will add remaining directives incrementally

- See `docs/PATH-AND-INTERACTIONS-ANALYSIS.md` for full analysis

**Directive Interactions** ✅ COMPLETE
- Analyzed all 11 new directives for required interactions
- Added 16 interaction entries covering:
  - 4 FP directives (test_purity, api_design, documentation, naming_conventions)
  - 6 Project directives (file_read, file_delete, task_create, subtask_create, item_create, sidequest_create)
- See `docs/PATH-AND-INTERACTIONS-ANALYSIS.md` for detailed rationale
