# MCP:
add return_statements table.
Return statement will be appended to return from helper functions as an object. Internal helper function should be created to get this return statement and should be called with every tool. Should we limit to tools as they will be the most called by AI, or should we add to every tool and helper (is_sub_helper =false)? We can add additional direction and checks for AI with these return statments including suggestions and notes. 

return notes should be added in for helper_functions in MCP core database.
return_statements_helpers table should be added. All helpers will query the return_statements_helpers table by helper_functions id and get the return statements before returning values.

directives_helpers table
Instead of listing then in the directives text directly. Easier to maintain

status
get tasks complete last 2 or 3 for reference
get tasks incomplete and
get_task_files(task_id) for list of files to be worked on for incomplete tasks
get_incomplete_tasks()
   all tasks with milestone_id having status != completed
   calls get_incomplete_subtasks()
   calls get_incomplete_sidequests()
   returns list of all that exists so that AI/user can have all information at once.
