# PROJECT:
remove project ID fields from all but project table. Should only be one project per database. Should enforce this.

project table entry is a singular entry that defines the broader scope of the project and the infrastructure table relates to it directly.

there should be getter and setters for general update project details and update project infrastructure. These are pretty standalone and don't need very munch interconnection. Directives must show when/how to use these tools during changes.

TOOLS
create_project(name, purpose, goals, status, version, user_directives_status:None)
last_known_git_hash and last_git_sync fields initial values populated automatically.
update_project(name:None, purpose:None, goals:None, status:None, version:None, user_directives_status:None)
add_infrastructure(type, value, description)
update_infrastructure(id, type:None, value:None, description:None)

HELPERS is_sub_helper=true
project_update_git_status()
No parameters needed. get's git data to update last_known_git_hash and last_git_sync 

We must add a delete_entry(table:string, id:int, note_reason:text, note_severity:string , note_source:string"ai" or "user", note_type: "entry_deletion") helper function tool, so that we can easily remove anything. Note fields are forced because any removal of an entry should require a note. Is there anything to add to return statement?

to avoid the repeat update/create timestap function calls for EVERY SINGLE DATABASE INTERACTION, we need to set triggers for these:

CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp
AFTER UPDATE ON your_table
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   UPDATE your_table
   SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   WHERE id = OLD.id;
END;

CREATE TRIGGER set_created_at
BEFORE INSERT ON your_table
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   -- Set created_at to current timestamp if not already provided
   -- If you want the flexibility to optionally set it manually, you can include a check
   -- to use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP only if created_at is NULL.
   UPDATE your_table
   SET created_at = COALESCE(NEW.created_at, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
   WHERE rowid = NEW.rowid;
END;

TOOL
blueprint_has_changed() creates checksum of project blueprint, then evaluates against current checksum in db. returns true or false.

There is only one project per database. We should remove all project ID fields from the other tables as we do not need to waste processing by having to account for that field in all of the tables with every update. Either that or default the project ID to 1, which "should" be the actual project ID. But I recommend removing the project id field from all tables as even having them suggests that there could potentially be more than one project per database, which is not the case.

Themes and flows have to do with project categorization and organization.
Themes are more broad categorization of the various parts of the project. Flows are more detailed strings of actions that are related more to code categorization. A theme could have several flows, but a flow could touch on several themese potentially. Checkout could be a theme and (shipping calculation, tax, payment selection type, payment processing, address entry, etc.) could all be flows that touch on checkout. Address entry could potentially also touch on theme User Registration for example.

## files, functions, types. These all have to do with file and code tracking.
should have an add_file tool and set_function tool to quickly and easily update the database after every file change. These will be used the most and should be very streamlined. 

TOOL
add_file(path, language)
checksum automated with code (created_at automated with trigger)

HELPER is_sub_helper=true
update_file(id) 


if modifying a file, functions will be modified, so no need for an update file tool, just a helper function (is_sub_helper = true). when updating function, code will call update file, pass file id and update the updated_at and checksum fields automatically. AI doesn't need to worry about this. 

File should have a has_changed function. Simply return true or false. 

TOOL
file_has_changed(path) creates checksum of file, then evaluates against current checksum in db. returns true/false

For all tables since we have both created at and updated at, we should have a check for setters and automatically add updated at if exists, automatically add created at if not exists and ignore the other in both cases (if create ignore update, if update ignore create). AI should not have to worry about created at, updated at, checksums. These should be automated. 

HELPER is_sub_helper=true
get_function_by_id(id)

We have get_function_by_name but we should also have a get_function(id) that can be used for a quicker query by index id, if needed this will be used probably internally. If not needed now, it's handy to have already for any potential use case in the future or if AI has the ID but lost context or never had context regarding function entry table. Potentially a getter of a list of function ID's or some reference to function by ID and need to retrieve the rest of the function db data.

FUNCTION NAMES UNIQUE!!!!
Since this is FP, we do not have classes and therefore, function names cannot be duplicate??????? This is language agnostic so we don't know what language the use will be using and therefore we can't assume that the language will allow overloading. We should either make the name unique or create a function sig with name and params and force the sig to be unique. What do you think is best? Is overloading absolutely necessary? Our get_function for instance. We could have overloading get_function(id), and get_function(path). Or we could have get_function(id:None, path:Node){if id and path are none, return error; one is required). or we could just be very explicit like what we are doing with get_function_by_name(name) and get_function_by_id(id). So maybe we should make the function names unique. add function should throw errors when duplicate function names are used. 

## adding functions
additional-helper-project.md:
"`add_function(name: str, signature: str, file_id: int, is_pure: bool = false, dependencies: list = None)`"
We do not have a signature field for functions. Necessary? Useful? Should we add to schema or remove from additional helpers?
File ID would have to be looked up before adding to paramaters. Let's let the code handle this and not put the burden on AI. One Parameter should be (file path) path: str. We do not have an is_pure field in functions table. Why is this here? Is it in directives? Or did you make this up out of thin air last session? Is it useful and needed? We should discuss.
dependencies are in the interactions table. This function isn't correct at all. Needs to be rewritten and re-evaluated. If this is completely wrong, many others might also be completely wrong. All helper functions in all helper functions files need to be reviewed.

add_function should take name, path (or file_path), purpose, parameters, returns? Should we add the function return values if exist? If so, then this should be a filed added to the functions table.
path is known by AI because it was working on the file before the update tool call. We want to limit the work AI needs to do, so it can easily pass path. We can derive file ID from path. If we fail at the lookup, we can return a file path error to AI so it can figure out what went wrong.

TOOL
add_function(name, path, purpose, params, returns)

update_file(id) called with every add_function using derived file ID from path.

created at field given current timestamp
updated at filed not update.
TRIGGERS NEED TO BE SET FOR THESE SO WE DON"T HAVE TO MANAGE MANUALLY WITH EVERY FUNCTION CALL

return_statements should include "are there any interactoins with this function"

helper/tool return must include function table new entry id and a note "Do any interactions need to be added for this new function? Does the file database entry need to be updated?".
These return notes should be added in as new filed in helper_functions table in MCP core database.
return_statements. String, text or json. Not sure. All tools will query their own function by name and get the return statement before returning values. Return statement will be appending to return from helper functions.


## Need to evaluate interactions table. How useful is it?

## updating functions
TOOL
update_function(name, purpose=None, parameters=None, returns=None)
we will manage updated_at timestamp if sqlite doesn't do this automatically. Check purpose, parameters and returns for None to identify whether those fields need to be updated. 

return_statements should include "are there any interactoins with this function"

return data should include function ID and interaction data for that function. Use get_interactions and append to return data with a note "do interactions need updating?". AI will always get and read the return data, so if it includes the necessary data for potential chaining, AI doesn't have to execute additional commands which would be needed anyway. We can think ahead for this.

HELPER is_sub_helper=false
update_function_file(name, path) 
This will be a helper function, not a tool. available for use but path parameter not included in standard update_function tool because it's seldom, if ever, to be changed. The file a function lives in, once set, should be pretty much static. But there are occasions where a function might need to be moved to another file (probably for organization purposes) and so we should have a helper function for this. We willl pass path, function will look up path for existing file ID. If not exists, return error that path was not found in files table. Else, get file id from path and then update file_id in functions table entry by function name. Obviously if function name not found, error returned noting that no function with name found in database. 

update_file(id) called with every update function usind derived file id from path

additional-helpers-project.md "#### `update_function_purity(function_name: str, is_pure: bool)`
**Purpose**: Mark function as pure/impure after FP compliance check.
**Returns**: `{"success": true, "function": "...", "is_pure": true}`
**Use Case**: FP directives update purity status"
We don't have a purity field in the functions table. Review directives to check for any mention of this. If doesn't exist, explain use. I think we can remove this and will need to check for other useless helpers that have no database or directive mention.

TOOL:
add_functions(path, [(name,purpose,params,returns),(name,purpose,params,returns)...])
update_file(id) called with every add_functions using derived file id from path. For this function, it's possible that add_functions() is used as a one-shot, meaning that adding all functions done at once and file entry is expected to be created from this. So ID cannot be derived from path, add_file(path) will be called instead. This function will add/update files table entry FIRST, then proceed to process the function entries.

TOOL:
update_functions_for_file(path,[(name, purpose=None, parameters=None, returns=None), (name, purpose=None, parameters=None, returns=None), ...])
We will NOT have a generic update_functions (not path needed). This enforces that functions in mass can only be updated for ONE file at a time. This prevents potential errors in attempting to update multiple functions accross multiple files. AI can probably handle this just fine, but it's very error prone when doing that. So if many files were modified, it can call update_functions_for_file multiple times, once for each file. It's just safer.
update_file(id) called with every update function usind derived file id from path

## types
linked_function_id INTEGER,                -- Optional: ADT associated with specific function
So why the single linked_function_id?
If your design is recording the origin or defining function of a type (not every function that can operate on it), then one function makes sense:
Example: linked_function_id points to the constructor, definition site, or type declaration function.
Otherwise, if you intend to model all operations a type supports, you’d use a link table, e.g.:
CREATE TABLE types_functions (
    type_id INTEGER REFERENCES types(id),
    function_id INTEGER REFERENCES functions(id),
    role TEXT  -- e.g. 'constructor', 'method', 'operator', etc.
);

name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
definition_json TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON schema for ADT (e.g., {"type": "enum", "variants": ["A", "B"]})
description TEXT,
linked_function_id INTEGER,                -- Optional: ADT associated with specific function

TOOLS:
add_type(name, definition_json, description) (links if we won't migrate to types_functions table)
add_types([(name, definition_json, description), (name, definition_json, description),... ])
update_type(name, definition_json:None, description:None)
update_types([(name, definition_json:None, description:None), (name, definition_json:None, description:None), ...])

## types_functions
TOOLS
link_type_function(type_name, function_name, role)
link_type_function_by_id(type_id function_id, role)
link_types_functions([(type_name, function_name, role),(type_name, function_name, role)...])

## interactions : get, add, update
Need to evaluate interactions table. How useful is it?

GET:
get_all_intereactions(limit=None, orderby=None), get_interactons_by_source(name, limit=None, orderby=None), get_interactions_by_target(name, limit=None, orderby=None), get_interactons_by_type(type, limit=None, orderby=None), get_interactions(source, target), get_interaction_by_name(name, limit=None, orderby=None)- gets all interactions where function name is source or target, get_interaction(id)

UPDATE:
update_interaction(id, source=None, target=None, type=None, descripton=None). 

ADD:
source_function_id  target_function_id  interaction_type description. 
add_interaction(source, target, type, description)
add_interactions(aray of [(source, target, type, description),(source, target, type, description),...])

## file_flows
TOOL
set_file_flows(file_id, flow_id)
get_files_by_flow(flow_id) TODO: return statements for flows and files relating to this (adding)
get_flows_for_file(file_id)

## themes

## flows

## completion_path, milestones
milestones relate to a certain step in the completion path. There could be many milestones before a step in the completion path can be marked as completed and the next step began. 


## flow_themes
we should have a flow to theme relation setter and getter tools.

## tasks, subtasks, sidequests and items. 
These all have to do with project progress tracking.
subtasks are children to tasks so the milestone is inherited from parent task. sidequest is immediate need issues and is not necessarily related to milestone/task/subtask. It may fall under these but it's more a "there is a problem and we need to pause everything and fix this" or "we need to make adjustments and these adjustments (dependencies, organization, clarifications, issues, etc.) must be completed before continuing with reglar work.". So it should be treated in this manner. Should have a get tasks by count, date as well. Get 3 latest tasks for instance. Should have an option in that actually for status. get 3 latest tasks complete. get all tasks incomplete (0 or -1 value for count). or unset, get 3 latest tasks (any status). Should exted this tool with a parameter of type for task, subtask or sidequest. As all should have these/this tool.

tasks have a flow_ids json table for related flows. We shouldn't have the need for getting tasks by flow as a general rule. tasks should be usually linear. Usually about one task at a time. Once items are complete, task is marked as complete and no real need for accessing that task in the future apart from general review for potential historical reference. But for task context, flows will be useful and therefore the flow_ids fields lists them. Should have a tool to update task flows and get task flows. These are separate from the general get tasks tool as they may probably be used more often. Subtasks inherit task flow(s). Sidequests are not necessarily flow specific. 

items are a series of task/subtask/sidequest items. The task/subtask/sidequest are high level descriptors of the set of "items" that must be accomplished. The items for that task/subtask/sidequest are created and must be fully completed before the task/subtask/sidequest can be marked as complete. This isn't a strict rule that should be forced however as a user can decide a task is complete and that certain items can be discarded. AI should discard accordingly, but this is normal user/AI interaction and doesn't need to be added to directives. We just don't want to make the directives too strict and so I'm clarifying my statemnt that "items.. must be fully complete before task/subtask/sidequest can be marked as complete" in order to show it as a generally obvious rule but not a strictly forced directive.
