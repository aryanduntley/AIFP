# PROJECT:
NOTE: reference to (*Can Be Null) or =None is there to in indcate that the parameter is optional. Usually added to update functions so that the code can decide if passing empty value to clear value in db or passing null to skip any update to this field.

remove project ID fields from all but project table. Should only be one project per database. Should enforce this.

project table entry is a singular entry that defines the broader scope of the project and the infrastructure table relates to it directly.

there should be getter and setters for general update project details and update project infrastructure. These are pretty standalone and don't need very munch interconnection. Directives must show when/how to use these tools during changes.

TOOLS
create_project(name, purpose, goals, status, version, user_directives_status(*Can Be Null))
last_known_git_hash and last_git_sync fields initial values populated automatically.
update_project(name(*Can Be Null), purpose(*Can Be Null), goals(*Can Be Null), status(*Can Be Null), version(*Can Be Null), user_directives_status(*Can Be Null))
add_infrastructure(type, value, description)
update_infrastructure(id, type(*Can Be Null), value(*Can Be Null), description(*Can Be Null))

HELPERS is_sub_helper=true
project_update_git_status()
No parameters needed. get's git data to update last_known_git_hash and last_git_sync 

to avoid the repeat update/create timestap function calls for EVERY SINGLE DATABASE INTERACTION, we need to set triggers for these:

CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp
AFTER UPDATE ON your_table
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   UPDATE your_table
   SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   WHERE id = OLD.id;
END;

CREATE TRIGGER set_created_at
BEFORE INSERT ON your_table
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   -- Set created_at to current timestamp if not already provided
   -- If you want the flexibility to optionally set it manually, you can include a check
   -- to use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP only if created_at is NULL.
   UPDATE your_table
   SET created_at = COALESCE(NEW.created_at, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
   WHERE rowid = NEW.rowid;
END;

TOOL
blueprint_has_changed() creates checksum of project blueprint, then evaluates against current checksum in db. returns true or false.

There is only one project per database. We should remove all project ID fields from the other tables as we do not need to waste processing by having to account for that field in all of the tables with every update. Either that or default the project ID to 1, which "should" be the actual project ID. But I recommend removing the project id field from all tables as even having them suggests that there could potentially be more than one project per database, which is not the case.

Themes and flows have to do with project categorization and organization.
Themes are more broad categorization of the various parts of the project. Flows are more detailed strings of actions that are related more to code categorization. A theme could have several flows, but a flow could touch on several themese potentially. Checkout could be a theme and (shipping calculation, tax, payment selection type, payment processing, address entry, etc.) could all be flows that touch on checkout. Address entry could potentially also touch on theme User Registration for example.

## files, functions, types. These all have to do with file and code tracking.
should have an add_file tool and set_function tool to quickly and easily update the database after every file change. These will be used the most and should be very streamlined. 

## files
WE SHOULD ADD file_name to files table. After doing so, should we include file name in path?

TOOL
reserve_file(name, path, language)
reserve_files([(name,path,language), (name,path,language),...])
finalize_file(file_id, name, path, language) acts as an update, but automtically removes the is_reserved flag
finalize_files([(file_id, name, path, language), (file_id, name, path, language), ...])
checksum automated with code (created_at automated with trigger)
return_statements should include "verify flows are added, if necessary, for this file in file_flows table"
checks if file actually exists in path. If not exists return "file does not exists, cannot add to database"

delete_file(file_id, note_reason:text, note_severit:string, note_source:string "ai" or "user", note_type: "entry_deletion") must delete all file_flows with file_id. must get all functions id's with file_id. must delete all types with function_id and if exists must delete all types_functions with function_id. must delete all interactions with function_id as source or target. must delete all functions with file_id

NOTE: DIRECTIVES UPDATE NEEDED
I was going to add a header comment for each file, but there are so many different comment types based on language and file extension that I don't want to have to have a bunch of logic to do this. We could return the desired metadata to AI to figure out comment syntax and add the metadata itself, but I really want to keep AI from dealing with EVERYTHING and let code handle things that are very routine and shouldn't require much thinking (I don't want to write the logic). So, for file metadata I think this should happen:
I have made another modification. I was going to automatically with rename_file and rename_function programmatically change the file names with -IDxxx and function names with _idxxx called after every add_file or update_file. But is could be VERY error prone. Instead, we'll make a reserve system. AI will first have to reserve_file/reserve_files or reserve_function/reserve_functions to get reserved ID's. These tables that will have associated file/function/type id's must have an is_reserved filed added to the tables. This will return the ID's for proper naming. After create/write, AI can then call finalize functions to populate the data correctly.

remove ALL add_file or similar. Must reserve and then finalize instead of simply "add".

reserve_file(name, path, language)
reserve_files() array of parameters
   name, path and language aren't extremely necessary, but it's ok to put useful or expected data here
   simply add to database the values. Triggers set created_at. No checksum created. is_reserved is set to 1/true
   returns reserved id or id's for use in file name
   FILE NAMING CONVENTION is name-IDxxx (-ID1 or -ID32, etc)
   return_statements should include "Use the returned id(s) for file naming. File names should be suffixed with -IDxx. Once created, call finalize_file(s) to update file name and any other data'
finalize_file(file_id, name, path, language)
finalize_files() array of parameters
   name, path and language updated with real values (name definitely update since new name will contain the entry id, others are optional since it's possible there were no changes to the data from reserving)
   checks if file actually exists in path. If not exists return "file does not exists, cannot add to database"
   checksum created
   triggers set updated_at
   is_reserved set to 0/false
   return_statements should include "verify flows are added, if necessary, for this file in file_flows table"

HELPER is_sub_helper=true
update_file_timestamp(file_id) this is primarily for function updates. If a function is updated, the file last updated timestamp should be updated. checksum gets updates (since this call is automated after every function update). No need for a separate call by AI. 

TOOLS
get_file(file_id)
update_file(file_id, new_name(*Can Be Null), new_path(*Can Be Null), language(*Can Be Null))
   null means do not update this field.
   checksum must be updated automatically here
   return_statements should include "verify flows are added, if necessary, for this file in file_flows table", "Ensure that any name or path changes are thoroughly changed in the code base as well"

File should have a has_changed function. Simply return true or false. 

TOOL
file_has_changed(file_id) creates checksum of file, then evaluates against current checksum in db. returns true/false

IF TRIGGERS NOT DOABLE:
For all tables since we have both created at and updated at, we should have a check for setters and automatically add updated at if exists, automatically add created at if not exists and ignore the other in both cases (if create then ignore update, if update then ignore create). AI should not have to worry about created at, updated at, checksums. These should be automated. But if triggers for this can be done, we don't have to worry about it

HELPER is_sub_helper=false
get_function(function_id)
get_function_by_name(function_name)

FUNCTION NAMES UNIQUE!!!!
Since this is FP, we do not have classes and therefore, function names cannot be duplicate??????? This is language agnostic so we don't know what language the use will be using and therefore we can't assume that the language will allow overloading. We should either make the name unique in database table as flat or create a function sig with name and params and force the sig to be unique. What do you think is best? Is overloading absolutely necessary? Our get_function for instance. We could have overloading get_function(id), and get_function(name). Or we could have get_function(id(*Can Be Null), name(*Can Be Null)){if id and name are none, return error; one is required}. or we could just be very explicit like what we are doing with get_function_by_name(name) and get_function(function_id). So maybe we should make the function names unique. add function should throw errors when duplicate function names are used.

NOTE: DIRECTIVES UPDATE NEEDED
FUNCTION METADATA
Will add function ID to function name. so it's always readily available. could be placed in docstring, but trying to account for all language syntax becomes a problem. NAMING CONVENTION _idxxx (_id1 or _id32, etc.) as suffix

   reserve_function(name, file_id, purpose, params, returns)
   reserve_functions() array of parameters
      name, file_id, purpose, params, returns aren't extremely necessary, but it's ok to put useful or expected data here
      simply add to database the values
      is_reserved is set to 1/true
      returns reserved id or id's for use in function name
      FUNCTION NAMING CONVENTION is name_idxxx (_id1 or _id32, etc)
      return_statements should include "Use the returned id(s) for function naming. Function names should be suffixed with _idxx. Once created, call finalize_function(s) to update file name and any other data'
   finalize_function(function_id, name, file_id, purpose, params, returns)
   finalize_functions() array of parameters
      name, file_id, purpose, params, returns, are updated with real values (name required since new name will contain the entry id, others are optional since it's possible there were no changes to the data from reserving)
      call update_file_timestamp(file_id) (for each unique file_id). This updates the tiemstamp and checksum
      is_reserved set to 0/false 
      return_statements should include "Do any database interactions need to be added for this function"

## adding functions
additional-helper-project.md:
"`add_function(name: str, signature: str, file_id: int, is_pure: bool = false, dependencies: list = None)`"
We do not have a signature field for functions. Necessary? Useful? Should we add to schema or remove from additional helpers?
We do not have an is_pure field in functions table. Why is this here? Is it in directives? Or did you make this up out of thin air last session? Is it useful and needed? We should discuss.
dependencies are in the interactions table. This function isn't correct at all. Needs to be rewritten and re-evaluated. If this is completely wrong, many others might also be completely wrong. All helper functions in all helper functions files need to be reviewed.

remove ALL add_function or similar. Must reserve and then finalize instead of simply "add".

TOOLS
reserve_function(name, file_id, purpose, params, returns)
   id returned for use in actual function naming. sets is_reserved to true
reserve_functions() array of parameters
   id's returned for use in actual function names. is_reserved set to true for each
Created_at should be triggered

finalize_function(function_id, name, file_id, purpose, params, returns)
   is_reserved set to false/0
finalize_functions() array of parameters
   is_reserved set to false/0
Updated_at should be triggered

These return notes should be added in as new filed in helper_functions table in MCP core database.
return_statements. String, text or json. Not sure. All tools will query their own function by name and get the return statement before returning values. Return statement will be appending to return from helper functions.

TOOL
delete_function(function_id, note_reason:text, note_severit:string, note_source:string "ai" or "user", note_type: "entry_deletion") must delete all types with function_id and if exists must delete all types_functions with function_id. must delete all interactions with function_id as source or target.

## updating functions
file_id should be returned after any update so that update_file_timestamp can be called
TOOL
update_function(function_id, name=None, purpose=None, parameters=None, returns=None)
we will manage updated_at timestamp if sqlite doesn't do this automatically. Check purpose, parameters and returns for None to identify whether those fields need to be updated. 

return_statements should include "are there any interactions with this function" and "Ensure that you have updated ay and all references to this funtion if the name, parameters or returns have been changed", "Do any database interactions need to be added for this function"

return data should include function ID and interaction data for that function. Use get_interactions and append to return data with interactions return_statements. AI will always get and read the return data, so if it includes the necessary data for potential chaining, AI doesn't have to execute additional commands which would be needed anyway. We can think ahead for this.

HELPER is_sub_helper=false
update_function_file_location(function_id, old_file_id, new_file_id) 
This will be a helper function, not a tool. available for use but file location parameter not included in standard update_function tool because it's seldom, if ever, to be changed. The file a function lives in, once set, should be pretty much static. But there are occasions where a function might need to be moved to another file (probably for organization purposes) and so we should have a helper function for this. Any three parameters not found in db, return error so AI knows it needs to check param values.
return_statements should include "make sure that any calls or references to this function have updated paths", "Do any database interactions need to be added for this function"
update_file_timestamp(file_id) should be called for each file (from and to)

additional-helpers-project.md "#### `update_function_purity(function_name: str, is_pure: bool)`
**Purpose**: Mark function as pure/impure after FP compliance check.
**Returns**: `{"success": true, "function": "...", "is_pure": true}`
**Use Case**: FP directives update purity status"
We don't have a purity field in the functions table. Review directives to check for any mention of this. If doesn't exist, explain use. I think we can remove this and will need to check for other useless helpers that have no database or directive mention.

TOOL:
update_functions_for_file(file_id,[(name=None, purpose=None, parameters=None, returns=None), (name=None, purpose=None, parameters=None, returns=None), ...])
We will NOT have a generic update_functions (where no file ID set). This enforces that functions in mass can only be updated for ONE file at a time. This prevents potential errors in attempting to update multiple functions accross multiple files. AI can probably handle this just fine, but it's very error prone when doing that. So if many files were modified, it can call update_functions_for_file multiple times, once for each file. It's just safer.
return_statements should include "if name changed, ensure that the prefix _idxxx is retained and if anything but purpose is updated, ensure that all references/calls in code are also updated", "Do any database interactions need to be added for this function"
update_file_timestamp(file_id) called


## types
remove ALL add_type or similar. Must reserve and then finalize instead of simply "add".

linked_function_id INTEGER,                -- Optional: ADT associated with specific function
So why the single linked_function_id?
If your design is recording the origin or defining function of a type (not every function that can operate on it), then one function makes sense:
Example: linked_function_id points to the constructor, definition site, or type declaration function.
Otherwise, if you intend to model all operations a type supports, you’d use a link table, e.g.:
CREATE TABLE types_functions (
    type_id INTEGER REFERENCES types(id),
    function_id INTEGER REFERENCES functions(id),
    role TEXT  -- e.g. 'constructor', 'method', 'operator', etc.
);

name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
definition_json TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON schema for ADT (e.g., {"type": "enum", "variants": ["A", "B"]})
description TEXT,
linked_function_id INTEGER,                -- Optional: ADT associated with specific function

TOOLS:
reserve_type(name, definition_json, description, links:object, file_id)
   id returned for use in actual type naming
   sets is_reserved to true
reserve_types() array of parameters
   id's returned for use in actual type names
   is_reserved set to true for each
Created_at should be triggered
TYPE NAMING CONVENTION is name_idxxx (_id1 or _id32, etc)
return_statements should include "Use the returned id(s) for type naming. Type names should be suffixed with _idxx. Once created, call finalize_typ(s) to update file name and any other data'

finalize_type(type_id, name, definition_json, description, links:object, file_id)
   is_reserved set to false/0
   all values except name are optional (possibly set correctly in reserve_type)
finalize_types() array of parameters
   is_reserved set to false/0
Updated_at should be triggered
return_statements should include "verify whether any type_functions relationships need to be added to the database for this new type", "should any functions be linked in the types_functions table for this type"

update_type(id, name(*Can Be Null), file_id(&Can Be Null), definition_json:CanBeNull, description(*Can Be Null))
file_id should be returned after update so that:
update_file_timestamp(file_id) called
return_statements should include "are there any types_functions relationships that should be added" and "Ensure that you have updated ay and all references to this type if the name has been changed"

      Discuss if this is useful
      if we are to have likely many to many relationships between types and functions, then we should probably add _idxxx to types name in file as well?
      and we should add file_id to types for quick file reference and updated_at call whenever a type is modified.
      If we were to do this, the logic would look pretty much exactly the same as functions

delete_type(type_name, note_reason:text, note_severit:string, note_source:string "ai" or "user", note_type: "entry_deletion") must delete all types with name.

NOTE: DIRECTIVES UPDATE NEEDED
TYPE METADATA
Will add type ID to type name in code. so it's always readily available. NAMING CONVENTION _idxxx (_id1 or _id32, etc.) as suffix. Types table should have file_id filed added to track types file it belongs to.

## milestones
completion_path_id name status description
milestones relate to a certain step in the completion path. There could be many milestones before a step in the completion path can be marked as completed and the next step began. 

TOOLS

HELPERS is_sub_helper = false


## tasks, subtasks, sidequests and items. 
These all have to do with project progress tracking.
subtasks are children to tasks so the milestone is inherited from parent task. sidequest is immediate need issues and is not necessarily related to milestone/task/subtask. It may fall under these but it's more a "there is a problem and we need to pause everything and fix this" or "we need to make adjustments and these adjustments (dependencies, organization, clarifications, issues, etc.) must be completed before continuing with reglar work.". So it should be treated in this manner. Should have a get tasks by count, date as well. Get 3 latest tasks for instance. Should have an option in that actually for status. get 3 latest tasks complete. get all tasks incomplete (0 or -1 value for count). or unset, get 3 latest tasks (any status). Should exted this tool with a parameter of type for task, subtask or sidequest. As all should have these/this tool.

tasks have a flow_ids json table for related flows. We shouldn't have the need for getting tasks by flow as a general rule. tasks should be usually linear. Usually about one task at a time. Once items are complete, task is marked as complete and no real need for accessing that task in the future apart from general review for potential historical reference. But for task context, flows will be useful and therefore the flow_ids fields lists them. Should have a tool to update task flows and get task flows. These are separate from the general get tasks tool as they may probably be used more often. Subtasks inherit task flow(s). Sidequests are not necessarily flow specific. 

items are a series of task/subtask/sidequest items. The task/subtask/sidequest are high level descriptors of the set of "items" that must be accomplished. The items for that task/subtask/sidequest are created and must be fully completed before the task/subtask/sidequest can be marked as complete. This isn't a strict rule that should be forced however as a user can decide a task is complete and that certain items can be discarded. AI should discard accordingly, but this is normal user/AI interaction and doesn't need to be added to directives. We just don't want to make the directives too strict and so I'm clarifying my statemnt that "items.. must be fully complete before task/subtask/sidequest can be marked as complete" in order to show it as a generally obvious rule but not a strictly forced directive.

## Tasks
tasks linked to flows. flows linked to files. this relationship for tasks to files is sufficent as tasks are very temporary. Once done, they are only there for potential historical reference, nothing more. So getting flows for task, then get_files_by_flow(flow_id). Can loop through flows for all related files if necessary.
