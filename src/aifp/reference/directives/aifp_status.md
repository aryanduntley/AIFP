# aifp_status - Project Status Reporting Directive

**Type**: Project Management
**Level**: 1
**Parent**: `aifp_run`
**Category**: Status & Context

---

## Purpose

`aifp_status` provides comprehensive project context for continuation and status checking. It reads ProjectBlueprint.md, queries project.db, and returns a structured status report with historical context, open items, and recommended actions.

**Use this directive when**:
- User requests continuation ("continue", "resume", "what's next")
- User asks for status ("status", "where are we", "show progress")
- Starting task decomposition (context-aware planning)
- AI needs project context after context loss

---

## When to Use

### Automatic Triggers

Keywords that trigger `aifp_status`:
- "continue", "resume", "keep going"
- "status", "progress", "where are we"
- "what's next", "what should I do"
- "show me", "summarize", "update"

### Proactive Calls

Called by other directives:
- `project_task_decomposition` ‚Üí Calls `aifp_status` first for context
- `aifp_run` ‚Üí Routes continuation requests to `aifp_status`
- `project_evolution` ‚Üí Checks status before architectural changes

---

## Workflow

### Trunk: `generate_status_report`

**Step 1: Read ProjectBlueprint.md**

```python
# Load blueprint for high-level context
blueprint_path = f"{project_root}/.aifp-project/ProjectBlueprint.md"
blueprint_content = read_file(blueprint_path)

# Parse sections
project_overview = parse_section(blueprint_content, "1. Project Overview")
technical_blueprint = parse_section(blueprint_content, "2. Technical Blueprint")
themes_flows = parse_section(blueprint_content, "3. Project Themes & Flows")
completion_path = parse_section(blueprint_content, "4. Completion Path")
```

**Step 2: Query project.db for Current State**

```sql
-- Get project metadata
SELECT name, purpose, status, version, goals_json
FROM project
WHERE id = 1;

-- Get completion path with progress
SELECT cp.name, cp.status, cp.description,
       COUNT(m.id) as total_milestones,
       SUM(CASE WHEN m.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_milestones
FROM completion_path cp
LEFT JOIN milestones m ON m.completion_path_id = cp.id
GROUP BY cp.id
ORDER BY cp.order_index;

-- Get active milestones
SELECT m.name, m.status, m.description,
       COUNT(t.id) as total_tasks,
       SUM(CASE WHEN t.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_tasks
FROM milestones m
LEFT JOIN tasks t ON t.milestone_id = m.id
WHERE m.status IN ('in_progress', 'pending')
GROUP BY m.id;

-- Get open tasks (pending or in_progress)
SELECT t.id, t.name, t.status, t.priority, t.description,
       m.name as milestone_name
FROM tasks t
JOIN milestones m ON t.milestone_id = m.id
WHERE t.status IN ('pending', 'in_progress')
ORDER BY t.priority DESC, t.created_at ASC;

-- Get active sidequests
SELECT name, reason, status, priority
FROM sidequests
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'in_progress')
ORDER BY priority DESC;

-- Get recent notes (last 10)
SELECT content, note_type, source, created_at
FROM notes
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Step 3: Build Status Tree**

```python
status_report = {
    "project": {
        "name": project_name,
        "purpose": project_purpose,
        "version": project_version,
        "status": project_status
    },
    "completion_path": [
        {
            "stage": stage_name,
            "status": stage_status,
            "progress": f"{completed_milestones}/{total_milestones} milestones"
        }
    ],
    "current_focus": {
        "milestone": active_milestone_name,
        "progress": f"{completed_tasks}/{total_tasks} tasks",
        "open_tasks": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Implement multiply", "priority": 1}
        ]
    },
    "sidequests": [
        {"name": "Fix type hint", "reason": "Test failure", "priority": 1}
    ],
    "recent_activity": [
        {"note": "Added matrix operations", "source": "ai", "when": "2 hours ago"}
    ],
    "recommendations": [
        "Continue with task #5: Implement multiply_matrices",
        "Address sidequest: Fix type hint in add_matrices"
    ]
}
```

**Step 4: Return Status Report**

Returns structured JSON with full context.

## Edge Cases

### Case 1: Project Not Initialized

**Trigger**: `.aifp-project/` doesn't exist

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Project not initialized",
  "recommendation": "Run `aifp init` to initialize project"
}
```

---

### Case 2: No Open Tasks

**Trigger**: All tasks completed for current milestone

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "current_focus": {
    "milestone": "Matrix Operations",
    "progress": "6/6 tasks",
    "status": "All tasks completed!"
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Mark milestone as completed",
    "Move to next milestone: Vector Operations",
    "Or run project_completion_check to verify stage completion"
  ]
}
```

---

### Case 3: Blueprint Out of Sync

**Trigger**: Blueprint checksum doesn't match database

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "warning": "ProjectBlueprint.md may be out of sync",
  "recommendation": "Run project_blueprint_update to sync",
  "current_focus": { ... }  // Still returns status
}
```

## Related Directives

### Primary Relationships

- **`aifp_run`** - Routes to this directive
- **`project_blueprint_read`** - Parses blueprint file
- **`project_task_decomposition`** - Uses status for context
- **`project_completion_check`** - Validates completion progress

  - `completion_path` table - stage progress
  - `milestones` table - milestone status
  - `tasks` table - open tasks
  - `sidequests` table - active sidequests
  - `notes` table - recent activity

**Write Operations**:
- None (read-only directive)

---

## FP Compliance

**Purity**: ‚úÖ Pure function
- No side effects (read-only)
- Deterministic given same database state
- Returns structured data

**Immutability**: ‚úÖ Immutable
- No state mutations
- Database reads only
- Report structure frozen

**Side Effects**: ‚úÖ Isolated
- File reads (effect isolated in helper)
- Database queries (effect isolated in helper)

---

## Error Handling

### File Not Found

**Trigger**: ProjectBlueprint.md missing

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "warning": "ProjectBlueprint.md not found",
  "fallback": "Using database only for status",
  "current_focus": { ... }  // Returns database-only status
}
```

### Database Query Failure

**Trigger**: Corrupt project.db or missing tables

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Database query failed: table 'tasks' does not exist",
  "recommendation": "Re-initialize project database"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Call for every continuation** - Provides essential context
2. **Use before task decomposition** - Prevents duplicate tasks
3. **Present recommendations** - AI should follow suggested actions
4. **Show hierarchical progress** - Completion path ‚Üí Milestones ‚Üí Tasks
5. **Highlight sidequests** - Address blockers before continuing
6. **Include recent activity** - Helps AI remember context
7. **Be concise to user** - Format status clearly, not verbose

---

## Version History

- **v1.0** (2025-10-23): Initial status directive
- **v1.1** (2025-10-24): Added ProjectBlueprint.md integration
- **v1.2** (2025-10-25): Added sidequest support and recommendations

---

## Notes

- This directive is essential for **stateful continuation**
- Combines file-based (blueprint) and database context
- Enables AI to pick up where it left off
- Reports should be **actionable** with clear next steps
