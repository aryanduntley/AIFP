# Directive: user_directive_status

**Type**: User System
**Level**: N/A (Query/Reporting)
**Parent Directive**: `aifp_status`
**Priority**: High

---

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive status reports for user directives, showing execution statistics, health, errors, and next actions. This directive aggregates data from multiple sources to provide a complete picture of the directive automation system.

**Responsibilities**:
1. Query directive status from database
2. Aggregate execution statistics
3. Check service health (schedulers, processes)
4. Analyze error patterns
5. Generate user-friendly status reports
6. Recommend actions based on status

**Context**: This is a **read-only reporting directive** - it doesn't modify any state.

---

## When to Apply

This directive applies when:
- User says: "directive status" / "show directive status"
- User says: "How are my directives doing?"
- **Automatic**: Part of `aifp_status` when project.user_directives_status != NULL
- User says: "Status of {directive_name}"
- User says: "Show logs for {directive_name}"

---

## Workflow

### Trunk: Generate Status Report

#### Step 1: Check Project Type

1. **Verify user directives enabled**:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_directives_status FROM project WHERE id = ?;
   ```

2. **If NULL**:
   ```
   AI: "This project doesn't have user directives enabled (Use Case 1).

   This is a standard software development project.

   To use directive automation, initialize as Use Case 2:
   'aifp run project_init --automation'"
   ```

#### Step 2: Query All Directives

```sql
SELECT
    ud.id,
    ud.name,
    ud.status,
    ud.trigger_type,
    ud.approved,
    ud.activated_at,
    ud.deactivated_at
FROM user_directives ud
ORDER BY
    CASE ud.status
        WHEN 'active' THEN 1
        WHEN 'in_progress' THEN 2
        WHEN 'paused' THEN 3
        WHEN 'error' THEN 4
        ELSE 5
    END,
    ud.name;
```

#### Step 3: Get Execution Statistics

For each directive:
```sql
SELECT
    total_executions,
    success_count,
    error_count,
    last_execution_time,
    last_execution_status,
    last_error_time,
    last_error_type,
    last_error_message,
    avg_execution_time_ms,
    next_scheduled_time
FROM directive_executions
WHERE directive_id = ?;
```

Calculate:
```python
success_rate = (success_count / total_executions * 100) if total_executions > 0 else 0
error_rate = (error_count / total_executions * 100) if total_executions > 0 else 0
```

#### Step 4: Check Service Health (for active directives)

```python
for directive in active_directives:
    if directive.trigger_type == 'time':
        # Check scheduler job exists
        job = scheduler.get_job(f"directive_{directive.id}")
        health = "OK" if job else "MISSING"

    elif directive.trigger_type == 'condition':
        # Check background process running
        health = "OK" if process_exists(directive.process_id) else "DOWN"

    elif directive.trigger_type == 'event':
        # Check event listener registered
        health = "OK" if listener_active(directive.id) else "INACTIVE"
```

#### Step 5: Analyze Recent Errors

```python
# Get recent errors from log files
recent_errors = parse_error_log(
    ".aifp-project/logs/errors/current_errors.log",
    directive_id=directive.id,
    last_hours=24
)

# Group by error type
error_summary = group_errors_by_type(recent_errors)
```

#### Step 6: Generate Status Report

**Overall Summary**:
```
📊 User Directive Status

Project: {project_name}
Status: {active|in_progress|disabled}

Summary:
  Active directives: {count}
  Paused directives: {count}
  In progress (testing): {count}
  Error state: {count}

  Total executions (24h): {count}
  Success rate (24h): {percentage}%
```

**Per-Directive Status**:
```
{status_icon} {directive_name}
   Status: {status}
   {Status-specific details}
   {Health check results}
   {Statistics}
   {Error summary if any}
```

#### Step 7: Recommend Actions

Based on status, recommend:
```python
recommendations = []

for directive in directives:
    if directive.status == 'error':
        recommendations.append(f"• Investigate {directive.name} errors")

    if directive.error_rate > 50 and directive.total_executions > 10:
        recommendations.append(f"• Consider deactivating {directive.name} (high error rate)")

    if directive.status == 'in_progress' and days_since_implementation > 7:
        recommendations.append(f"• {directive.name} has been in testing for {days} days - ready to approve?")

    if directive.status == 'paused' and last_deactivated_days_ago > 30:
        recommendations.append(f"• {directive.name} inactive for {days} days - delete or reactivate?")

if recommendations:
    AI: "📋 Recommended Actions:\n" + "\n".join(recommendations)
```

### Branches

#### Branch 1: Single Directive Status
- **Condition**: User asks about specific directive
- **Action**: Show detailed status for that directive only

#### Branch 2: Active Directives Only
- **Condition**: User asks "what's running?"
- **Action**: Filter to status = 'active' only

#### Branch 3: Error Report
- **Condition**: User asks "show errors"
- **Action**: Detailed error analysis with logs

#### Branch 4: Logs Display
- **Condition**: User asks "show logs for {name}"
- **Action**:
  1. Show recent log entries
  2. Offer to show full log file
  3. Provide log file path

---

### Fallback

If status query fails:
1. Report partial data if available
2. Indicate which data sources failed
3. Suggest manual inspection

## Edge Cases

### 1. **Database Unavailable**
- **Scenario**: Can't connect to databases
- **Handling**:
  - Report partial data from memory
  - Note database unavailable
  - Suggest checking database file

### 2. **Logs Missing**
- **Scenario**: Log files deleted or corrupted
- **Handling**:
  - Show database stats only
  - Note logs unavailable
  - Can't show recent execution details

### 3. **Inconsistent State**
- **Scenario**: DB says active but service not running
- **Handling**:
  - Report inconsistency
  - Show both DB status and actual health
  - Recommend manual investigation

### 4. **Very Long Status Report**
- **Scenario**: 50+ directives
- **Handling**:
  - Summarize by status first
  - Show detailed view for active only
  - Offer filtered views

### 5. **Status During Update**
- **Scenario**: Directive being updated while status checked
- **Handling**:
  - Show status = 'updating'
  - Note update in progress
  - Show what's happening

## Database Operations

### Tables Read (No Writes)

```sql
-- Project status
SELECT user_directives_status FROM project;

-- All directives
SELECT id, name, status, trigger_type, approved, activated_at, deactivated_at
FROM user_directives
ORDER BY status, name;

-- Execution statistics
SELECT *
FROM directive_executions
WHERE directive_id = ?;

-- Recent errors (optional, mainly from logs)
SELECT *
FROM notes
WHERE reference_table = 'user_directives'
  AND reference_id = ?
  AND note_type = 'error'
  AND created_at > datetime('now', '-24 hours')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Show All Directive Status
```
3 active directives
Expected: Summary + detailed status for each
Verify: Correct stats, health checks accurate
```

### Test 2: Show Single Directive
```
User asks about specific directive
Expected: Detailed single directive report
Verify: All stats, logs, dependencies shown
```

### Test 3: Error Detection in Status
```
Directive with high error rate
Expected: Highlighted in red, recommended actions
Verify: Error patterns detected, recommendations shown
```

### Test 4: Status with Inconsistent State
```
DB says active but process not running
Expected: Report inconsistency, both statuses shown
Verify: User alerted to investigate
```

### Test 5: Empty Status (No Directives)
```
No directives created yet
Expected: Friendly message, offer to get started
Verify: No errors, helpful guidance
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not Checking Service Health
**Wrong**: Only show database status
**Right**: Verify services actually running

### ❌ Mistake 2: Stale Statistics
**Wrong**: Show cached stats from hours ago
**Right**: Query fresh data each time

### ❌ Mistake 3: Overwhelming Output
**Wrong**: Show everything for 50+ directives
**Right**: Summarize first, details on request

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Errors
**Wrong**: Only show success stats
**Right**: Prominently display errors and patterns

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Recommendations
**Wrong**: Just show raw status
**Right**: Analyze and recommend actions

## Notes

**Read-Only**: This directive only queries and reports, never modifies state.

**Real-Time**: Status reflects current system state, not cached data.

**Actionable**: Always provide recommendations, not just raw data.

**User-Friendly**: Format for human readability with clear visual indicators.
