# Directive: project_milestone_complete

**Type**: Project
**Level**: 3 (Operational Execution)
**Parent Directive**: project_task_complete
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Ensures continuous project momentum across milestones

---

## Purpose

The `project_milestone_complete` directive handles the complete post-milestone completion workflow, ensuring seamless transition to the next phase of the project.

Key responsibilities:
- Marks milestone as complete
- Updates completion_path progress
- **Reviews overall project status**
- **Moves to next milestone automatically**
- **Creates first task for next milestone** (with user input)
- Checks for project completion

This directive ensures that **completing a milestone immediately transitions to the next phase**, preventing project stagnation and maintaining forward momentum.

---

## When to Apply

This directive is automatically triggered when:
- `project_task_complete` detects all tasks in milestone are done
- User explicitly says "complete milestone [name]"
- Final task in milestone is marked complete

**Delegation Chain**:
```
Final task in milestone completes
  ‚Üí project_task_complete (detects milestone complete)
  ‚Üí project_milestone_complete (handles next-milestone transition)
  ‚Üí Creates first task for next milestone
  ‚Üí IF all completion_paths complete ‚Üí project_completion_check
```

---

## Workflow

### Trunk: mark_milestone_complete

Primary execution path for milestone completion and next-phase planning.

### Branches

**Branch 1: If milestone_valid_for_completion**
- **Then**: `mark_complete_and_update_path`
- **Details**:
  - Updates milestone status to `completed`
  - Sets `completed_at` timestamp
  - Queries associated completion_path
  - Checks if completion_path is done
- **SQL**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE milestones
  SET status = 'completed', completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  WHERE id = ?;

  SELECT cp.id, cp.name, cp.status
  FROM completion_path cp
  JOIN milestones m ON m.completion_path_id = cp.id
  WHERE m.id = ?;

  -- Check if all milestones in path are complete
  SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_milestones
  FROM milestones
  WHERE completion_path_id = ? AND status NOT IN ('completed', 'cancelled');
  ```

**Branch 2: If completion_path_complete**
- **Then**: `mark_path_complete`
- **Details**:
  - Updates completion_path status to `completed`
  - Logs path completion
- **SQL**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE completion_path
  SET status = 'completed', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  WHERE id = ?;

  INSERT INTO notes (content, note_type, reference_table, reference_id, source, directive_name)
  VALUES ('Completion path completed: [path_name]', 'path_completion', 'completion_path', ?, 'directive', 'project_milestone_complete');
  ```

**Branch 3: If completion_path_complete**
- **Then**: `check_project_completion`
- **Details**:
  - Queries all completion_paths for project
  - Checks if project is entirely complete
- **SQL**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_paths
  FROM completion_path
  WHERE project_id = ? AND status NOT IN ('completed');
  ```
- **Result**: project_complete or project_not_complete

**Branch 4: If project_complete** üéâ
- **Then**: `call_project_completion_check`
- **Details**:
  - All completion_paths done!
  - Delegates to `project_completion_check` for final validation
  - Triggers project archival workflow
- **Delegation**: `project_completion_check(project_id, trigger_final_review=true)`

**Branch 5: If project_not_complete** ‚≠ê **NEXT MILESTONE**
- **Then**: `move_to_next_milestone`
- **Details**:
  - Calls `aifp_status` (brief) to show overall progress
  - Shows completion_path progress
  - Queries next pending milestone:
    ```sql
    SELECT m.id, m.name, m.description
    FROM milestones m
    JOIN completion_path cp ON m.completion_path_id = cp.id
    WHERE cp.project_id = ? AND m.status = 'pending'
    ORDER BY cp.order_index, m.id
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
  - Presents milestone completion summary:
    ```
    Milestone '[milestone_name]' completed!
    Project progress: [X/Y completion paths complete]
    Moving to next milestone: '[next_milestone_name]'
    ```

**Branch 6: If next_milestone_identified**
- **Then**: `discuss_first_task`
- **Details**:
  - Engages user in planning first task
  - Options:
    1. Let AI suggest first task based on milestone description
    2. User defines first task manually
    3. Review milestone details before deciding
  - **Critical**: AI and user collaborate on next steps
- **Prompt**:
  ```
  Next milestone: '[milestone_name]'
  Description: [milestone_description]

  What should be the first task?
  ```

**Branch 7: If user_chooses_ai_suggestion**
- **Then**: `suggest_and_create_task`
- **Details**:
  - AI analyzes milestone description
  - Suggests task name and task items
  - Prompts user for approval:
    ```
    Suggested first task:
    Name: [suggested_task_name]
    Items:
    - [item_1]
    - [item_2]
    - [item_3]

    Approve and create this task?
    ```
  - If approved: Delegates to `project_task_create`

**Branch 8: If user_defines_task**
- **Then**: `create_user_defined_task`
- **Details**:
  - Prompts for task name
  - Prompts for task description
  - Prompts for task items
  - Delegates to `project_task_create`

**Fallback**: `prompt_user`
- User clarification needed
- Review milestone details

### Error Handling

**on_failure**: `prompt_user`
**retry**: max 1 attempt

- If milestone update fails: Rollback and prompt user
- If next milestone not found: Check for project completion or pivot

## Examples

### Example 1: Milestone Complete, Next Milestone Ready

**Context**:
- Completed: Milestone "Database Schemas" (5/5 tasks complete)
- Completion Path: "Foundation" (3/6 milestones complete)
- Next: Milestone "Core Types"

**Triggered by**: project_task_complete (final task in milestone)

**AI Execution**:
1. Marks milestone complete:
   ```sql
   UPDATE milestones SET status = 'completed', completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = 2;
   ```
2. Checks completion_path:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM milestones WHERE completion_path_id = 1 AND status NOT IN ('completed', 'cancelled');
   -- Result: 3 (milestones remaining in path)
   ```
3. Path NOT complete ‚Üí **Move to next milestone**:
   - Calls `aifp_status` (brief)
   - Queries next milestone:
     ```sql
     SELECT m.id, m.name, m.description
     FROM milestones m
     JOIN completion_path cp ON m.completion_path_id = cp.id
     WHERE cp.project_id = 1 AND m.status = 'pending'
     ORDER BY cp.order_index, m.id LIMIT 1;
     -- Result: Milestone 3 "Core Types" - "Define core FP-compliant types and data structures"
     ```
4. Presents to user:
   ```
   üéâ Milestone 'Database Schemas' completed!

   Project progress: Foundation (3/6 milestones complete)

   Moving to next milestone: 'Core Types'
   Description: Define core FP-compliant types and data structures

   What should be the first task for this milestone?
   1. Let AI suggest first task
   2. I'll define the first task
   3. Review milestone details first
   ```
5. User chooses: "Let AI suggest first task"
6. AI suggests:
   ```
   Suggested first task:
   Name: Define Result type for error handling
   Items:
   - Create Result<T, E> type definition
   - Add success and error constructors
   - Implement pattern matching helpers
   - Write unit tests
   - Document usage examples

   Approve and create this task?
   ```
7. User approves
8. Delegates to `project_task_create`:
   - Creates task with 5 items
   - Sets status to `in_progress`
   - Links to milestone 3

**Result**: Seamless transition to next milestone with first task created

### Example 2: Completion Path Complete, More Paths Remain

**Context**:
- Completed: Milestone "Packaging" (final milestone in "Finalization" path)
- Completion Path: "Finalization" (3/3 milestones complete)
- Project: 5/6 completion paths complete
- Next: Completion Path "Documentation"

**AI Execution**:
1. Marks milestone complete
2. Checks completion_path:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM milestones WHERE completion_path_id = 6 AND status NOT IN ('completed');
   -- Result: 0 (all milestones in path complete!)
   ```
3. **Completion path complete**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE completion_path SET status = 'completed', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = 6;
   ```
4. Checks project completion:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM completion_path WHERE project_id = 1 AND status NOT IN ('completed');
   -- Result: 1 (one path remaining)
   ```
5. Project NOT complete ‚Üí **Move to next completion_path**:
   - Queries next milestone from remaining path
   - Presents similar workflow as Example 1

**Result**: Automatic transition to next completion_path

### Example 3: Project Complete!

**Context**:
- Completed: Final milestone in final completion_path
- All completion_paths: 6/6 complete

**AI Execution**:
1. Marks milestone complete
2. Marks completion_path complete
3. Checks project completion:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM completion_path WHERE project_id = 1 AND status NOT IN ('completed');
   -- Result: 0 (all paths complete!)
   ```
4. **Project complete**! üéâ
5. Delegates to `project_completion_check`:
   - Validates project is truly done
   - Generates completion report
   - Offers archival options
6. Presents to user:
   ```
   üéâüéâüéâ PROJECT COMPLETE! üéâüéâüéâ

   All completion paths finished:
   - Foundation (6/6 milestones)
   - Core Helpers (4/4 milestones)
   - MCP Server (5/5 milestones)
   - Core Directives (3/3 milestones)
   - Directive Expansion (4/4 milestones)
   - Finalization (3/3 milestones)

   The AIFP project is complete and ready for deployment!

   Next steps:
   1. Review final documentation
   2. Archive project
   3. Deploy to production
   ```

**Result**: Project completion validated and celebrated!

### Example 4: No Next Milestone (Unexpected)

**Context**:
- Milestone complete but no next milestone found
- Possible data issue or incomplete roadmap

**AI Execution**:
1. Marks milestone complete
2. Queries next milestone:
   ```sql
   SELECT m.id FROM milestones m WHERE ... LIMIT 1;
   -- Result: No rows
   ```
3. **No next milestone found**:
   - Checks if all milestones/paths complete (should trigger project_complete)
   - If not, this is an issue
4. Prompts user:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Milestone 'Database Schemas' complete, but no next milestone found.

   This may indicate:
   1. Project roadmap is incomplete
   2. All work is done (project complete)
   3. Data integrity issue

   Would you like to:
   1. Review ProjectBlueprint.md to clarify roadmap
   2. Call project_completion_check to verify status
   3. Manually create next milestone
   ```

**Result**: Edge case handled gracefully

## Integration with Other Directives

### Called By:
- `project_task_complete` - Delegates when all tasks in milestone are done

### Calls:
- `aifp_status` - Shows project progress (brief mode)
- `project_task_create` - Creates first task for next milestone
- `project_completion_check` - If all completion_paths done
- `project_evolution` - If user wants to pivot roadmap

### Triggers:

---

## Database Updates

### Tables Modified:

**project.db**:
```sql
-- Mark milestone complete
UPDATE milestones SET status = 'completed', completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?;

-- Mark completion_path complete (if all milestones done)
UPDATE completion_path SET status = 'completed', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?;

-- Log milestone completion
INSERT INTO notes (content, note_type, reference_table, reference_id, source, directive_name)
VALUES ('Milestone completed: [name]', 'milestone_completion', 'milestones', ?, 'directive', 'project_milestone_complete');

-- Log path completion (if applicable)
INSERT INTO notes (content, note_type, reference_table, reference_id, source, directive_name)
VALUES ('Completion path completed: [name]', 'path_completion', 'completion_path', ?, 'directive', 'project_milestone_complete');
```

### Tables Queried:
```sql
-- Check remaining milestones in path
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM milestones WHERE completion_path_id = ? AND status NOT IN ('completed', 'cancelled');

-- Check remaining paths in project
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM completion_path WHERE project_id = ? AND status NOT IN ('completed');

-- Get next milestone
SELECT m.id, m.name, m.description
FROM milestones m
JOIN completion_path cp ON m.completion_path_id = cp.id
WHERE cp.project_id = ? AND m.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY cp.order_index, m.id LIMIT 1;

-- Get completion_path info
SELECT id, name, order_index, status FROM completion_path WHERE project_id = ? ORDER BY order_index;
```

## Roadblocks and Resolutions

### Roadblock 1: no_next_milestone
**Issue**: No next milestone found after completion
**Resolution**: Check for project completion or review roadmap with user

### Roadblock 2: next_milestone_unclear
**Issue**: Milestone description is vague, can't suggest first task
**Resolution**: Review ProjectBlueprint.md with user to clarify

### Roadblock 3: user_wants_pivot
**Issue**: User wants to change roadmap after milestone
**Resolution**: Call `project_evolution` to handle roadmap change

### Roadblock 4: data_integrity_issue
**Issue**: Milestone marked complete but tasks remain
**Resolution**: Log error, prompt user to investigate
