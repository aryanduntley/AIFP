# [PROJECT_NAME] - Project Blueprint

<!--
  AIFP PROJECT BLUEPRINT - TEMPLATE
  ==================================
  This file was created by aifp_init (Phase 1: mechanical setup).

  ALL sections below contain placeholders that MUST be populated by AI
  during Phase 2 of project initialization, after interacting with the
  user to understand the project's scope, goals, and technical details.

  Placeholders are marked with [BRACKETS]. AI must replace every
  bracketed placeholder with real project data.

  DO NOT leave any [BRACKET] placeholders in the final blueprint.
  AI should remove this comment block after all sections are populated.

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Initialized - Awaiting Population
**Last Updated**: [DATE]
**AIFP Compliance**: Strict

## 1. Project Overview

### Idea

[Describe the project idea in 2-3 sentences. What does this project do? What problem does it solve?]

### Current Phase

**Initialized** - Project structure created, awaiting full setup:
- Databases initialized (project.db, user_preferences.db)
- Infrastructure detection pending
- Blueprint population pending

### Goals

[List 3-6 concrete project goals. Examples:]
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

### Success Criteria

[List measurable success criteria. What must be true for this project to be "done"?]
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Criterion 3]

---

## 2. Technical Blueprint

### Language & Runtime

- **Primary Language**: [e.g., Python 3.11+, TypeScript, Rust]
- **Runtime/Framework**: [e.g., FastAPI, Node.js, Actix]
- **Build Tool**: [e.g., pip, npm, cargo]

### Architecture Style

- **Paradigm**: Functional Procedural (AIFP)
- **Pattern**: Pure functions with explicit data flow, effect isolation
- **State Management**: Immutable data structures with Result types, no mutations

### Key Infrastructure

[List key dependencies, libraries, and tools. Examples:]
- [Dependency 1]: [Purpose]
- [Dependency 2]: [Purpose]

### Package Structure

[Describe the source directory layout. Example:]
```
src/
[Populate with actual project structure after infrastructure detection]
```

---

## 3. Project Themes & Flows

### Themes

[Themes are high-level groupings of related functionality. Examples:]

1. **[Theme Name]**
   - Purpose: [What this theme covers]
   - Files: [Which source files belong to this theme]

### Flows

[Flows are sequences of operations that implement features. Examples:]

1. **[Flow Name]**
   - Steps: [Step 1] -> [Step 2] -> [Step 3]
   - Related Themes: [Which themes this flow touches]

---

## 4. Completion Path

[Define the stages from start to finish. Every AIFP project has a finite completion path.]

### Stage 1: Foundation

**Key Milestones**:
- [Milestone 1]
- [Milestone 2]

### Stage 2: Core Development

**Key Milestones**:
- [Milestone 1]
- [Milestone 2]

### Stage 3: Testing & Finalization

**Key Milestones**:
- [Milestone 1]
- [Milestone 2]

---

## 5. Evolution History

### Version 1 - [DATE]

- **Change**: Initial project setup
- **Rationale**: [Why this project was created]

---

## 6. User Settings System

### Purpose

Allow users to customize AI behavior on a per-directive basis through atomic key-value preferences stored in `user_preferences.db`.

### Active Preferences

[No preferences set yet. Preferences are created when users express coding style preferences.]

---

## 7. User Custom Directives System

[This section applies only if the project uses Use Case 2: Custom Directive Automation.]

**Status**: [NULL - not applicable / in_progress / active / disabled]

[If Use Case 2: Describe what automation directives the user wants to define.]
[If Use Case 1: This section can note "Not applicable - regular software development project."]

---

## 8. Key Decisions & Constraints

### Architectural Decisions

[Record important architectural choices made during project setup. Examples:]
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale]

### Constraints

- **FP Compliance Mandatory**: All code must be pure functional (no OOP, no mutations)
- [Additional project-specific constraints]

---

## 9. Notes & References

### Important Context

[Record any context that future sessions should know about. Examples:]
- [Context note 1]
- [Context note 2]

### External References

[Links to relevant documentation, APIs, or resources.]
- [Reference 1]
- [Reference 2]
